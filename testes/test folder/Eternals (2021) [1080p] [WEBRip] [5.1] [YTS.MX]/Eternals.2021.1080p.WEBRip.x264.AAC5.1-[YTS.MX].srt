1
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,277
It is time.

2
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,690
It's beautiful, isn't it?

3
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:28,358
I'm Ikaris.

4
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:30,695
I'm Sersi.

5
00:03:06,815 --> 00:03:09,441
It's coming! Run!

6
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:14,113
Father!

7
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,322
Run!

8
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,662
Good fight.

9
00:04:02,912 --> 00:04:04,122
You, too.

10
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,226
Thank you, Ajak.

11
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:34,123
Shit.

12
00:07:37,668 --> 00:07:40,505
Excuse me. Excuse me.

13
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,025
I know I'm late, Charlie.

14
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:08,074
"In this broad
Earth of ours,

15
00:08:08,241 --> 00:08:11,577
"Amid the measureless
grossness and the slag,

16
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:14,956
"Enclosed and safe
within its central heart,

17
00:08:15,123 --> 00:08:17,708
"Nestles the seed Perfection."

18
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,462
The poet's hope and optimism
in humanity

19
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:24,048
echoes our recent
universal victory,

20
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:26,092
the return of half
our population...

21
00:08:26,259 --> 00:08:27,343
And, thank God, there she is.

22
00:08:28,845 --> 00:08:30,680
Our brilliant museum
scientist, Ms. Sersi,

23
00:08:30,763 --> 00:08:32,056
the person who will be

24
00:08:32,223 --> 00:08:34,225
and was always supposed to be

25
00:08:34,308 --> 00:08:35,726
giving you your
presentation today.

26
00:08:35,935 --> 00:08:38,729
Thank you, Mr. Whitman.
Sorry I'm late, everyone.

27
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,731
Today, we'll be learning
about the importance

28
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:43,776
of apex predators in
a balanced ecosystem.

29
00:08:45,111 --> 00:08:46,112
Poetry?

30
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,613
I completely
ran out of things to say,

31
00:08:47,697 --> 00:08:49,824
and these kids
make me nervous.

32
00:08:49,991 --> 00:08:52,201
Well, I thought you were
very charming, Professor.

33
00:08:52,785 --> 00:08:53,828
See you tonight.

34
00:08:53,995 --> 00:08:56,622
Ooh! "See you tonight."

35
00:08:56,706 --> 00:08:58,374
All right, settle down.

36
00:09:00,877 --> 00:09:01,878
So...

37
00:09:02,336 --> 00:09:04,755
who can tell me
what an apex predator is?

38
00:09:05,214 --> 00:09:06,924
Animals that hunt their
prey for food.

39
00:09:07,091 --> 00:09:08,259
Very good.

40
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:10,761
Apex predators do hunt
their prey for food,

41
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:12,096
like all predators.

42
00:09:12,263 --> 00:09:14,098
But one thing that sets
them apart

43
00:09:14,265 --> 00:09:16,851
is that there are no other
animals in their habitat

44
00:09:16,934 --> 00:09:18,895
strong enough to hunt them.

45
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:21,480
Who can give me an example?

46
00:09:21,648 --> 00:09:22,649
Lions.

47
00:09:22,815 --> 00:09:24,567
- Wolves.
- Correct.

48
00:09:27,195 --> 00:09:28,404
Earthquake.

49
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:32,825
Get down. Get down!

50
00:09:32,992 --> 00:09:35,662
It's an earthquake, everyone.
Get down! Under the tables!

51
00:09:36,996 --> 00:09:39,999
Let me help you.
Don't worry,
it'll pass soon.

52
00:09:48,049 --> 00:09:49,967
It's all right. Come here.

53
00:09:51,886 --> 00:09:54,096
You're all right.
You're all right.

54
00:10:37,181 --> 00:10:38,599
I like this song.

55
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:39,892
Me, too.

56
00:10:40,935 --> 00:10:42,270
Do you wanna dance?

57
00:10:43,229 --> 00:10:44,397
Wait, what the hell?

58
00:10:45,356 --> 00:10:46,565
Your hand!

59
00:10:47,316 --> 00:10:51,153
You've had too much to drink.
I gotta go.

60
00:10:56,284 --> 00:11:00,706
♪ Happy birthday to you

61
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:05,876
♪ Happy birthday, dear Dane

62
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:10,006
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

63
00:11:10,172 --> 00:11:12,091
- Hip, hip!
- Hooray!

64
00:11:19,265 --> 00:11:20,767
Is this from the
Middle Ages?

65
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,143
It has
your family crest.

66
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:24,603
It must have cost
a fortune.

67
00:11:24,979 --> 00:11:26,605
I'm a good eBay bidder.

68
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,691
Thank you.

69
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,651
Happy birthday.

70
00:11:33,237 --> 00:11:36,157
So, have you given
any more thought

71
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,908
to us moving in together?

72
00:11:38,075 --> 00:11:40,244
Yeah, I... I thought about it.

73
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:43,414
I can't move in with you.

74
00:11:43,581 --> 00:11:45,416
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
Thought you'd say that.

75
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:46,626
I'm sorry.

76
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,086
And I think I know why.

77
00:11:51,047 --> 00:11:52,465
Are you a wizard?

78
00:11:52,965 --> 00:11:53,966
What?

79
00:11:54,342 --> 00:11:56,135
Yeah, like Doctor Strange.

80
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:57,219
No. I'm...

81
00:11:57,386 --> 00:11:58,596
I've noticed some unusual
things happen

82
00:11:58,680 --> 00:11:59,681
when I'm around you.

83
00:11:59,847 --> 00:12:01,808
Like our water always
turns to coffee

84
00:12:01,891 --> 00:12:02,892
whenever the waiter
ignores us.

85
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,060
That's your caffeine
addiction talking.

86
00:12:04,226 --> 00:12:07,021
And Sprite says things...
Mm.

87
00:12:07,104 --> 00:12:08,648
...like you and your
ex-boyfriend

88
00:12:08,732 --> 00:12:10,149
broke up a century ago.

89
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:11,777
She said that?

90
00:12:11,942 --> 00:12:13,152
And he can fly.

91
00:12:13,653 --> 00:12:15,237
He's a pilot.

92
00:12:16,113 --> 00:12:18,366
Get a room, you two.

93
00:12:18,449 --> 00:12:20,910
Can we go now?
It's past my bedtime.

94
00:12:24,955 --> 00:12:26,999
Are you really in love?

95
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,417
What if I am?

96
00:12:28,584 --> 00:12:30,754
You better tell him
the truth, then.

97
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,546
I'm working on it.

98
00:12:44,016 --> 00:12:45,518
You guys wanna get pizza?

99
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:46,936
No, thank you!

100
00:12:48,896 --> 00:12:51,273
He won't live forever,
you know.

101
00:12:51,357 --> 00:12:52,358
Move in with him.

102
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:54,235
I live with you.

103
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:57,656
Dane.

104
00:13:00,491 --> 00:13:02,243
Shit! Is that
a Deviant?

105
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,036
Dane, run!

106
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:16,675
Sersi?
Let's go.

107
00:13:18,384 --> 00:13:20,762
What is that thing?
A Deviant!

108
00:13:20,928 --> 00:13:22,096
You said you killed
them all!

109
00:13:22,263 --> 00:13:23,264
You told him that?

110
00:13:23,431 --> 00:13:25,015
You believed me?
I do now!

111
00:13:31,731 --> 00:13:33,274
What are you doing?

112
00:13:33,441 --> 00:13:34,483
Keep Dane safe!

113
00:13:34,651 --> 00:13:36,527
Sersi, wait! What?

114
00:13:44,994 --> 00:13:46,120
You're fine, dude.

115
00:13:46,287 --> 00:13:47,413
Sprite!

116
00:13:52,627 --> 00:13:54,545
No. Stairs.

117
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,251
Run! Go! Go!

118
00:14:34,418 --> 00:14:35,795
- Go!
- Come on!

119
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:44,846
It knows where we are!

120
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:46,096
How?

121
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:48,224
I don't know!

122
00:14:49,183 --> 00:14:50,184
Sprite!

123
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:57,274
Sprite!

124
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,545
Ikaris!

125
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:20,632
Evening, ladies.

126
00:15:22,466 --> 00:15:23,551
Watch out!

127
00:15:39,734 --> 00:15:41,027
Wizard.

128
00:15:44,823 --> 00:15:45,907
Sorry.

129
00:16:07,136 --> 00:16:09,014
Did it just heal itself?

130
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:29,617
Ikaris.

131
00:16:30,994 --> 00:16:33,287
It's good to see you.

132
00:16:33,747 --> 00:16:35,581
It's good to
see you, too, Sprite.

133
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,589
I'm Dane.

134
00:16:43,757 --> 00:16:45,174
Hello, Dane.

135
00:16:45,717 --> 00:16:47,886
Well, I guess you must
be the pilot.

136
00:17:01,357 --> 00:17:04,526
We're Eternals,
from a planet called Olympia.

137
00:17:05,277 --> 00:17:08,197
We came here
7,000 years ago
on the Domo,

138
00:17:08,364 --> 00:17:11,785
our starship, to protect
humans from the Deviants.

139
00:17:12,744 --> 00:17:15,245
We thought we killed them all
five centuries ago,

140
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,956
but now they're back.

141
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:20,417
Look, if you don't
want to move in with me,

142
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:21,502
you could just say.

143
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,088
Dane, this is serious.

144
00:17:23,253 --> 00:17:24,839
Oh, I know. I'm just
still getting

145
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:26,256
over the fact you're
not a wizard.

146
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,425
I was hoping you could
change me into a giraffe.

147
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:30,095
I always wanted to be
a giraffe when I was a kid.

148
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:32,554
It's too bad I can't change
sentient beings.

149
00:17:32,722 --> 00:17:34,015
You would have made
a very cute giraffe.

150
00:17:39,228 --> 00:17:41,271
Why didn't you guys help
fight Thanos?

151
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:42,857
Or any war?

152
00:17:42,941 --> 00:17:44,651
Or all the other
terrible things
throughout history?

153
00:17:45,151 --> 00:17:46,152
We were instructed

154
00:17:46,235 --> 00:17:47,403
not to interfere in any
human conflicts

155
00:17:47,569 --> 00:17:48,612
unless Deviants
were involved.

156
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,989
Why?

157
00:17:50,156 --> 00:17:53,952
If we'd protected
humanity from everything

158
00:17:54,035 --> 00:17:55,369
for 7,000 years,

159
00:17:55,536 --> 00:17:57,621
you'd never have had
the chance to develop

160
00:17:57,706 --> 00:17:59,415
in the way
you were meant to.

161
00:17:59,581 --> 00:18:03,795
But if the Deviants were
eradicated a long time ago,

162
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:05,254
why are you still here?

163
00:18:05,421 --> 00:18:06,505
We've been waiting...

164
00:18:06,965 --> 00:18:09,008
to be told we can go home.

165
00:18:10,217 --> 00:18:12,053
So...

166
00:18:12,887 --> 00:18:14,097
Ikaris.

167
00:18:14,931 --> 00:18:16,850
The boy who flew
too close
to the sun.

168
00:18:17,349 --> 00:18:19,686
Sprite made that story up
when we lived in Athens.

169
00:18:19,853 --> 00:18:22,271
In the fifth century BC?

170
00:18:22,354 --> 00:18:23,982
How long were
you two together?

171
00:18:24,065 --> 00:18:25,108
5,000 years.

172
00:18:27,026 --> 00:18:29,028
I guess you can call
that long-term.

173
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,530
What happened?

174
00:18:31,906 --> 00:18:33,615
He left.

175
00:18:34,075 --> 00:18:37,369
I always thought
he'd come back, but...

176
00:18:37,871 --> 00:18:39,621
he never did.

177
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,582
So, I moved on.

178
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,417
I'm glad you did.

179
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,461
I'm sorry.

180
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,338
I have to go.

181
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,641
This morning,

182
00:18:58,725 --> 00:19:00,101
an unprecedented
global earthquake

183
00:19:00,267 --> 00:19:01,853
swept nation-states
across the world,

184
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,063
causing damage and panic.

185
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:06,816
Many have speculated
its connection with the Blip.

186
00:19:07,274 --> 00:19:09,235
The UN has called
for an emergency meeting...

187
00:19:09,401 --> 00:19:11,528
That Deviant healed itself.

188
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:14,573
They could never
do that before.

189
00:19:16,325 --> 00:19:18,494
And it was coming after us
instead of humans.

190
00:19:18,577 --> 00:19:19,746
What's going on?

191
00:19:19,913 --> 00:19:22,623
I came to check on you
because of the earthquake.

192
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,793
That Deviant is news to me.

193
00:19:27,837 --> 00:19:29,672
Something's happening
to Earth.

194
00:19:30,965 --> 00:19:32,759
Can't be a coincidence.

195
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,012
We need to find the others.

196
00:19:36,638 --> 00:19:38,597
I haven't seen
some of them for centuries.

197
00:19:38,765 --> 00:19:40,683
I doubt
much has changed.

198
00:19:50,902 --> 00:19:53,696
I'm sorry I hurt you, Sersi.

199
00:19:59,285 --> 00:20:01,204
But we need
to stick together.

200
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:04,666
And once I know you're safe,
I'll leave you alone.

201
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,961
Let's go to Ajak first.

202
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,755
She'll know what to do.

203
00:20:14,634 --> 00:20:16,343
You hear that, Sprite?

204
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:19,013
Family reunion.

205
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,890
It's about time.

206
00:20:32,986 --> 00:20:35,280
Hey, that one was mine!
Oh, never mind.

207
00:20:44,371 --> 00:20:45,581
Do not fear.

208
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,918
Quickly, inside the gate!

209
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:11,626
Ajak.

210
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,795
Arishem.

211
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:17,799
We continue to keep Babylon
safe from the Deviants.

212
00:22:17,966 --> 00:22:20,467
More people have come
to seek refuge.

213
00:22:20,635 --> 00:22:23,388
It is now the largest
city on Earth.

214
00:22:23,553 --> 00:22:25,306
The Eternals serving
their missions

215
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,391
across the galaxies

216
00:22:26,556 --> 00:22:28,267
will learn from your success.

217
00:22:28,685 --> 00:22:29,811
Thank you.

218
00:22:32,855 --> 00:22:36,067
I respect
your grand design, Arishem.

219
00:22:37,151 --> 00:22:40,863
But I have noticed something
special about this planet.

220
00:22:42,991 --> 00:22:46,285
And I fear that maybe
this time the cost may...

221
00:22:46,452 --> 00:22:49,163
Do not become
attached to this planet.

222
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:53,167
You must focus on the true
purpose of your mission.

223
00:22:54,584 --> 00:22:56,087
I understand.

224
00:22:57,296 --> 00:22:59,132
I will not let you down.

225
00:23:23,906 --> 00:23:24,949
Phastos.

226
00:23:25,074 --> 00:23:27,994
Did you go to the party
last night like I told you to?

227
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:29,162
The party, yeah.

228
00:23:29,328 --> 00:23:30,830
- Yeah, it was...
- He worked all night.

229
00:23:31,247 --> 00:23:32,248
Who was
talking to you?

230
00:23:32,415 --> 00:23:33,499
Get a life.

231
00:23:33,623 --> 00:23:35,752
And where is Sersi?
Late as usual.

232
00:23:35,918 --> 00:23:37,211
I'm sorry,
but I have something

233
00:23:37,295 --> 00:23:39,756
very exciting
to show you, okay?

234
00:23:39,922 --> 00:23:41,758
Wait till you see this.

235
00:23:45,552 --> 00:23:46,553
What is it?

236
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:48,264
It's an engine.

237
00:23:48,431 --> 00:23:51,476
It moves steam from
high pressure
to low pressure.

238
00:23:51,642 --> 00:23:53,436
Uh, it'll help them
till their fields

239
00:23:53,519 --> 00:23:54,687
at an incredibly
fast rate.

240
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:56,230
It's gonna freak them out.

241
00:23:56,647 --> 00:23:59,233
I mean, they only have had
the wheel 1,000 years, so...

242
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:02,278
You know,
we could do that thing

243
00:24:02,361 --> 00:24:04,447
where you use your mind
to control them

244
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:05,531
and then they could
do it quicker.

245
00:24:05,698 --> 00:24:06,949
Ajak, you listening
to this?

246
00:24:07,116 --> 00:24:09,952
Phastos, this steam...

247
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,121
Engine. It's a steam engine.
It's too soon.

248
00:24:12,705 --> 00:24:13,706
And there she is.

249
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,582
What did I miss?

250
00:24:15,833 --> 00:24:19,754
Nothing. Just the screams
of my deep disappointment.

251
00:24:19,921 --> 00:24:21,714
I am sure
you have something simpler.

252
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:22,840
Simple.

253
00:24:23,007 --> 00:24:25,802
Okay, let's see. Uh...

254
00:24:25,927 --> 00:24:28,888
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

255
00:24:30,223 --> 00:24:31,557
the plow.

256
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:34,519
'Cause that's what it does.

257
00:24:34,685 --> 00:24:35,978
Plows dirt.

258
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:37,480
I met another group
of settlers

259
00:24:37,563 --> 00:24:39,649
who are building their homes
in the northern fields.

260
00:24:39,732 --> 00:24:41,109
They'll need to plant
their own crops.

261
00:24:41,651 --> 00:24:43,236
- Thanks, Sersi.
- Listen,

262
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,281
humanity may be coming along
slower than some of us want.

263
00:24:48,241 --> 00:24:50,284
But there is no telling
what wonders

264
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:52,995
they will discover
as they advance.

265
00:24:54,372 --> 00:24:59,585
The wonders of the
world await you.

266
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:03,798
Follow Gilgamesh and
Enkidu into battle.

267
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:08,177
Be forever inspired
by their bravery and strength.

268
00:25:08,344 --> 00:25:11,806
You and your fellow man...

269
00:25:11,973 --> 00:25:14,851
...will go on great
adventures.

270
00:25:15,017 --> 00:25:18,104
And become legends
of your own!

271
00:25:23,109 --> 00:25:24,110
I just saw that.

272
00:25:24,277 --> 00:25:26,154
There's so many
other chairs, man.

273
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,488
You know,
I could use my powers...

274
00:25:27,655 --> 00:25:29,240
Come and have
a drink with me.

275
00:25:29,699 --> 00:25:30,700
No.

276
00:25:30,867 --> 00:25:32,618
I can't let you
go and fight
Deviants on your own.

277
00:25:32,785 --> 00:25:34,954
We need to guard the city.
Get out of my way.

278
00:25:35,705 --> 00:25:38,583
I didn't come to this planet
to cower behind walls.

279
00:25:39,083 --> 00:25:42,503
We need to trust Arishem's
design for this planet.

280
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:45,882
Hmm.
Thena.

281
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:50,720
It's an honor to fight
alongside you.

282
00:25:52,346 --> 00:25:53,598
And you.

283
00:25:57,143 --> 00:25:59,103
My beautiful Makkari.

284
00:25:59,187 --> 00:26:00,313
You're late.

285
00:26:00,438 --> 00:26:04,734
I needed
to get enough artifacts
to make a good trade.

286
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,448
Just lie to her.

287
00:26:15,244 --> 00:26:16,287
I can sense vibrations.

288
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:19,540
I can sense vibrations.

289
00:26:19,624 --> 00:26:21,334
Even the tiniest movement.

290
00:26:21,792 --> 00:26:26,088
Including your voices
when you speak.

291
00:26:26,589 --> 00:26:30,176
Did you two just
waste my time?

292
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,221
The Emerald Tablet you're
searching for...

293
00:26:33,387 --> 00:26:34,388
...is a myth!

294
00:26:48,819 --> 00:26:51,489
When humans have conflict,

295
00:26:51,572 --> 00:26:54,951
Ajak tells us not
to interfere.

296
00:26:55,117 --> 00:26:56,452
Well, she also says

297
00:26:56,535 --> 00:26:59,163
that stealing
is very, very bad.

298
00:27:02,792 --> 00:27:04,001
If you don't tell,

299
00:27:04,085 --> 00:27:05,544
I won't tell.

300
00:27:06,254 --> 00:27:07,338
Deal.

301
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:20,518
I promise I won't
let my feelings for Sersi

302
00:27:20,601 --> 00:27:21,894
distract me from my mission.

303
00:27:22,061 --> 00:27:23,647
Humans are far from being able

304
00:27:23,730 --> 00:27:25,231
to protect themselves
from the Deviants.

305
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:27,316
We still have much to do.

306
00:27:28,985 --> 00:27:30,987
Your faith in Arishem
is strong.

307
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,072
I can feel it.

308
00:27:34,949 --> 00:27:37,410
But you are allowed
to live a life, you know?

309
00:27:37,618 --> 00:27:40,454
Go tell Sersi how you feel.

310
00:28:06,605 --> 00:28:07,815
Try.

311
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:10,109
Sorry.

312
00:28:10,192 --> 00:28:11,444
I'm making a mess.

313
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:16,073
Well, not bad.

314
00:28:19,786 --> 00:28:20,870
See you.

315
00:28:21,871 --> 00:28:23,205
Let me help you.

316
00:28:50,232 --> 00:28:51,400
It matches
your eyes.

317
00:28:52,652 --> 00:28:53,944
You are very kind.

318
00:28:54,362 --> 00:28:56,280
You're learning
their language now?

319
00:28:56,447 --> 00:28:58,574
If I want to spend
more time with you,

320
00:28:58,742 --> 00:29:00,702
I need to get to know them.

321
00:29:03,079 --> 00:29:04,622
I am very beautiful.

322
00:29:07,083 --> 00:29:08,084
Wait,
what did I say?

323
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:11,462
You said,
"I am very beautiful."

324
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:15,634
You...

325
00:29:18,427 --> 00:29:21,138
You are
very beautiful, Sersi.

326
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,610
I'm yours, Sersi,

327
00:29:35,779 --> 00:29:36,780
if you'll have me.

328
00:30:21,783 --> 00:30:23,367
I love you, Ikaris.

329
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:27,789
I love you, Sersi.

330
00:30:47,349 --> 00:30:51,103
May the gods hereby
bond you in matrimony.

331
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:53,355
Congratulations.

332
00:31:35,147 --> 00:31:36,440
Hello?

333
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:41,278
Ajak?

334
00:32:06,012 --> 00:32:07,639
Ajak!

335
00:32:33,707 --> 00:32:35,374
It was a Deviant.

336
00:32:42,089 --> 00:32:45,175
♪ Our love

337
00:32:45,342 --> 00:32:48,680
♪ And our devotion

338
00:32:49,346 --> 00:32:54,351
♪ Were as deep as any ocean ♪

339
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:01,358
It was the last time
I saw her.

340
00:33:03,235 --> 00:33:06,072
Ajak asked me
to check on Sersi,

341
00:33:06,155 --> 00:33:07,406
so I went to London.

342
00:33:09,617 --> 00:33:11,327
Turned out, both of us
were lonely

343
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:13,038
and we needed each other.

344
00:33:14,831 --> 00:33:16,875
I guess, in her way,

345
00:33:17,042 --> 00:33:20,045
Ajak never stopped
trying to take care of us.

346
00:33:28,552 --> 00:33:29,929
Bye, Ajak.

347
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,977
It's the first time
in 7,000 years

348
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,103
one of us has died.

349
00:33:37,646 --> 00:33:40,189
I think the Deviant
that attacked us in London

350
00:33:40,356 --> 00:33:42,149
killed Ajak and absorbed
her power.

351
00:33:42,316 --> 00:33:44,027
Deviants have never
done that in the past.

352
00:33:44,193 --> 00:33:46,236
It healed itself
just like Ajak.

353
00:33:46,738 --> 00:33:49,323
I swear,
I almost heard it speak.

354
00:34:16,308 --> 00:34:18,268
- Arishem.
- Sersi.

355
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:20,063
It is almost time.

356
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:24,150
Sersi! Sersi!
Are you okay?

357
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:26,193
What happened, Sersi?

358
00:34:29,405 --> 00:34:31,825
The sphere that Ajak used
to talk with Arishem,

359
00:34:32,033 --> 00:34:34,535
it came out of her body
and went inside me.

360
00:34:34,703 --> 00:34:36,412
Did you talk with Arishem?

361
00:34:37,038 --> 00:34:38,665
Yes. He said

362
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:41,000
it's almost time.

363
00:34:42,251 --> 00:34:43,962
Can you try talking
to him again?

364
00:34:44,921 --> 00:34:46,296
I don't know how.

365
00:34:46,463 --> 00:34:48,340
But she chose you to
replace her.

366
00:34:49,008 --> 00:34:50,259
And she gave you
the sphere.

367
00:34:50,509 --> 00:34:51,593
Hold on, Sprite.

368
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,639
Are you sure
you talked with Arishem?

369
00:34:54,806 --> 00:34:56,099
What else would it be?

370
00:34:57,349 --> 00:34:58,600
Mahd Wy'ry.

371
00:35:34,971 --> 00:35:36,848
Where are the others?

372
00:35:37,306 --> 00:35:39,391
We had to split up.

373
00:35:40,018 --> 00:35:41,644
There were more Deviants
than you said.

374
00:35:41,811 --> 00:35:43,479
Well, I'm sure
that was a lot of fun
for you.

375
00:35:43,813 --> 00:35:45,023
It was.

376
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:49,276
Once the others
kill these last Deviants,

377
00:35:50,028 --> 00:35:52,279
we will have eliminated them
all from the planet.

378
00:36:09,672 --> 00:36:11,340
Don't.

379
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:15,220
We don't interfere
in their wars.

380
00:36:16,345 --> 00:36:17,889
This isn't war.

381
00:36:18,305 --> 00:36:19,849
It's genocide.

382
00:36:20,225 --> 00:36:22,268
Their weapons
have become too deadly.

383
00:36:23,645 --> 00:36:25,354
Maybe it wasn't
such a good idea

384
00:36:25,437 --> 00:36:26,815
helping them
advance, Phastos.

385
00:36:27,232 --> 00:36:30,567
Technology is a part
of their evolutionary
process, Druig.

386
00:36:30,735 --> 00:36:32,278
It's not exactly something
that I can stop.

387
00:36:32,444 --> 00:36:34,571
No, you can't. But I can.

388
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,115
Stay strong.

389
00:36:36,532 --> 00:36:38,201
It's too late.

390
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:40,912
Thena?
Everyone is going to die.

391
00:36:42,038 --> 00:36:43,039
Are you okay?

392
00:36:44,456 --> 00:36:45,457
Thena?

393
00:36:48,711 --> 00:36:51,297
Thena? Thena, no!
Thena!

394
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:22,036
Don't listen
to your head, Thena.

395
00:37:23,037 --> 00:37:24,998
Listen to my voice.

396
00:37:26,708 --> 00:37:28,375
You are safe.

397
00:37:29,501 --> 00:37:32,088
You are loved.

398
00:37:33,006 --> 00:37:35,758
You're our Thena.

399
00:37:42,098 --> 00:37:43,266
Hey, Thena!

400
00:37:43,432 --> 00:37:45,685
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

401
00:38:03,953 --> 00:38:05,537
- Is she okay?
- Yeah.

402
00:38:06,831 --> 00:38:07,957
Sersi.

403
00:38:08,124 --> 00:38:09,125
Thena, please.

404
00:38:09,751 --> 00:38:11,753
Come back to us.

405
00:38:11,878 --> 00:38:12,921
Okay.

406
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:31,856
I thought Mahd Wy'ry
was a myth.

407
00:38:35,276 --> 00:38:36,945
There is no cure...

408
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:39,280
so no one
really talks about it.

409
00:38:44,118 --> 00:38:45,119
What happened?

410
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:46,329
Thena.

411
00:38:46,495 --> 00:38:48,039
You attacked everyone.

412
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:50,833
Wounded Sersi, Phastos,

413
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,961
you nearly killed Makkari.

414
00:38:55,462 --> 00:38:57,298
I don't remember.

415
00:38:57,464 --> 00:38:59,549
You have Mahd Wy'ry.

416
00:38:59,717 --> 00:39:01,928
Your mind is fracturing

417
00:39:02,011 --> 00:39:03,888
under the weight
of your memories.

418
00:39:04,055 --> 00:39:08,309
And all I can do is erase them
so that you can start over.

419
00:39:09,435 --> 00:39:12,689
I will have to inform Arishem
and take you back to the ship

420
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:14,564
where we have the technology

421
00:39:14,649 --> 00:39:15,775
to help you.

422
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:18,111
But she won't be Thena
anymore.

423
00:39:18,277 --> 00:39:20,238
What if it happens again?
She could've killed you.

424
00:39:20,405 --> 00:39:21,906
She could have killed
all of us.

425
00:39:22,073 --> 00:39:23,074
Please.

426
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:27,245
Please, I...
I want to remember.

427
00:39:28,246 --> 00:39:30,123
I want to remember my life.

428
00:39:30,748 --> 00:39:32,250
Thena, I love you.

429
00:39:32,417 --> 00:39:34,043
But listen to me.

430
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:37,797
It's not important
if you remember or not.

431
00:39:38,339 --> 00:39:40,091
Your spirit will remain.

432
00:39:40,258 --> 00:39:43,052
You will always be Thena
deep inside.

433
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,511
Trust me.

434
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,930
Why should she trust you?

435
00:39:47,724 --> 00:39:50,351
You're asking her
to let you erase who she is.

436
00:39:50,517 --> 00:39:52,353
Druig, I know
you're upset, but...

437
00:39:52,519 --> 00:39:53,562
Upset?

438
00:39:55,564 --> 00:39:57,442
We've trusted you
for 7,000 years,

439
00:39:57,524 --> 00:39:58,776
and look where
you've gotten us.

440
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:03,114
I've watched humans
destroy each other

441
00:40:03,197 --> 00:40:05,283
when I could stop it all
in a heartbeat.

442
00:40:07,076 --> 00:40:09,787
Do you know what that does
to someone after centuries?

443
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,166
Could our mission
have been a mistake?

444
00:40:13,958 --> 00:40:15,376
Are we really
helping these people

445
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,170
build a better world, huh?

446
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,597
We're just like
the soldiers down there.

447
00:40:29,432 --> 00:40:31,600
Pawns to their leaders.

448
00:40:32,268 --> 00:40:34,353
Blinded by loyalty.

449
00:40:37,398 --> 00:40:39,108
It ends now.

450
00:40:56,834 --> 00:40:57,835
Let them go.

451
00:40:57,919 --> 00:40:59,545
You're gonna have to make me.

452
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:00,630
Stop.

453
00:41:07,178 --> 00:41:08,721
If you wanna stop me,

454
00:41:10,014 --> 00:41:11,891
you're gonna have to kill me.

455
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:37,416
I'll watch over Thena.

456
00:41:38,126 --> 00:41:39,210
Let her keep her memories.

457
00:41:40,461 --> 00:41:42,505
One day,
when she attacks you,

458
00:41:43,131 --> 00:41:45,174
you might have to kill her.

459
00:41:51,305 --> 00:41:53,057
We'll take that chance.

460
00:42:02,859 --> 00:42:04,026
You may all go.

461
00:42:06,487 --> 00:42:08,197
The Deviants are gone.

462
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:12,034
There is no reason
for you to stay with me.

463
00:42:12,201 --> 00:42:13,786
Shouldn't you ask
Arishem first?

464
00:42:13,953 --> 00:42:15,746
We're a team,
we should stay together.

465
00:42:15,913 --> 00:42:18,833
I didn't ask you
for your advice, Ikaris.

466
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,335
Do not forget your place.

467
00:42:24,547 --> 00:42:26,799
This is where we say goodbye.

468
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:29,510
You are free to go.

469
00:42:30,887 --> 00:42:33,055
I want you to go out there.

470
00:42:33,222 --> 00:42:35,975
And live a life
for yourselves.

471
00:42:36,142 --> 00:42:37,894
Not as soldiers.

472
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,564
Not with the purpose
you were given.

473
00:42:41,939 --> 00:42:44,734
Find your own purpose.

474
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,780
And one day,
when we see each other again,

475
00:42:52,241 --> 00:42:55,244
I want you to tell me
what you found.

476
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:02,752
♪ Come my way
Nach, mera hero

477
00:43:02,919 --> 00:43:05,171
♪ Get the evil away

478
00:43:05,296 --> 00:43:06,464

486
00:44:03,938 --> 00:44:05,064
Welcome.

487
00:44:05,231 --> 00:44:08,025
I am Karun Patel.

488
00:44:08,150 --> 00:44:09,402
Kingo's valet.

489
00:44:10,236 --> 00:44:12,280
It's truly an honor
to be in the presence

490
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:13,614
of the great Eternals.

491
00:44:15,408 --> 00:44:18,869
♪ Like the fire
Like the sun

492
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:22,666
♪ You have risen, Mighty one ♪

493
00:44:31,717 --> 00:44:33,635
Cut! Okay, everyone,

494
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,844
that was good.

495
00:44:35,011 --> 00:44:36,763
But we could do 10% better.

496
00:44:36,929 --> 00:44:39,015
That was beautiful.
Very, very good.

497
00:44:39,181 --> 00:44:40,933
Really, so good.

498
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:43,352
My friends
from college are here.

499
00:44:43,894 --> 00:44:44,895
Hello, boss!

500
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:46,897
Perfect timing!

501
00:44:46,981 --> 00:44:49,358
Welcome to the set of...

502
00:44:49,442 --> 00:44:51,235
Legend of Ikaris.

503
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,403
I'm playing you!

504
00:44:52,570 --> 00:44:54,238
You like the costume?
We need to talk.

505
00:44:54,405 --> 00:44:55,741
Tell the director
I have some notes for him...

506
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:57,074
We need to talk
to you in private.

507
00:44:57,701 --> 00:44:59,827
Oh, Karun, he's worked
with me for 50 years.

508
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,120
I trust him completely.

509
00:45:01,287 --> 00:45:03,707
Actually, when we first met,
he thought I was a vampire,

510
00:45:03,873 --> 00:45:05,166
and he tried to stake me
through the heart.

511
00:45:05,709 --> 00:45:07,418
I have apologized
so many times.

512
00:45:07,585 --> 00:45:08,795
Not quite enough times.

513
00:45:08,878 --> 00:45:10,171
Very close, though.
I'll let you know.

514
00:45:10,338 --> 00:45:11,757
Oh, I have to get ready
for the next scene.

515
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,341
Come to my tent,
we'll talk there.

516
00:45:13,507 --> 00:45:14,676
You guys are gonna love
the next scene.

517
00:45:14,842 --> 00:45:17,763
I come in on a wire
'cause, you know, I can't fly.

518
00:45:17,928 --> 00:45:19,597
Wait, are we
getting back together?

519
00:45:19,765 --> 00:45:20,766
We need to talk.

520
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,058
I've been waiting
for the day

521
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:23,225
the world learns
the true identity

522
00:45:23,309 --> 00:45:24,310
of the Shadow Warrior.

523
00:45:24,477 --> 00:45:25,936
Ajak's dead.

524
00:45:31,025 --> 00:45:32,401
She was killed.

525
00:45:33,319 --> 00:45:34,696
It was a Deviant.

526
00:45:39,241 --> 00:45:40,868
The Deviants are back.

527
00:45:41,035 --> 00:45:42,495
We don't know
how many there are.

528
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,958
You need to come with us.

529
00:46:04,183 --> 00:46:06,310
I can't just go. I mean,
all these people depend on me.

530
00:46:06,477 --> 00:46:07,854
We just started
shooting this movie.

531
00:46:07,937 --> 00:46:09,021
It's the first
of a trilogy.

532
00:46:09,648 --> 00:46:11,650
We just got BTS
to do a cameo...

533
00:46:13,234 --> 00:46:14,402
Sir,

534
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:16,780
may I say something?
Please don't say anything.

535
00:46:16,946 --> 00:46:17,988
I think you should go.

536
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:19,365
I just said don't
say anything.

537
00:46:19,532 --> 00:46:23,787
"Life affords no greater duty
than to protect one's family!"

538
00:46:24,620 --> 00:46:26,580
Remember? It's your
favorite line

539
00:46:26,748 --> 00:46:31,252
from The Shadow Warrior 2:
Voyage of Time.

540
00:46:32,002 --> 00:46:33,839
Your family needs you.

541
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:46,934
Seven thousand years.

542
00:46:48,728 --> 00:46:50,647
That's how long
the battle between Eternals

543
00:46:50,730 --> 00:46:52,440
and Deviants has raged for.

544
00:46:53,065 --> 00:46:55,067
You think I'm a movie star.

545
00:46:55,234 --> 00:46:58,070
Well, I am. But I am also...

546
00:46:58,988 --> 00:47:00,573
an Eternal.

547
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:02,241
Kingo, what
are you doing?

548
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:06,328
I think we should be
remembered, so...

549
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:10,667
I am making a documentary
about us.

550
00:47:10,792 --> 00:47:13,795
You are about to meet
my fellow Eternal, Sprite.

551
00:47:13,961 --> 00:47:16,172
Sprite, tell them
about yourself.

552
00:47:16,338 --> 00:47:17,674
Oh, wait.

553
00:47:21,552 --> 00:47:24,054
Okay, well,
we'll circle back to her.

554
00:47:24,723 --> 00:47:26,933
This is Sersi.

555
00:47:27,516 --> 00:47:28,517
Sersi,

556
00:47:28,685 --> 00:47:30,519
tell them about yourself.

557
00:47:32,354 --> 00:47:33,690
- Uh...
- We're rolling.

558
00:47:33,773 --> 00:47:34,774
Well, uh...

559
00:47:36,442 --> 00:47:41,030
I can change
a rock into water.

560
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:44,325
Uh, I could turn
a rock into wood.

561
00:47:44,492 --> 00:47:46,577
Or a rock into metal.

562
00:47:46,745 --> 00:47:48,830
Actually, one time,
I turned a rock into air.

563
00:47:48,955 --> 00:47:49,956
Cut.

564
00:47:50,039 --> 00:47:52,458
Um, you know what?
Why don't you think about it,

565
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,168
and we'll get back
to you, okay?

566
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:55,503
Let's go.

567
00:47:58,297 --> 00:48:00,634
Sprite says
you're addicted
to this thing.

568
00:48:02,761 --> 00:48:03,929
Oh, this?

569
00:48:04,804 --> 00:48:06,305
Look at this.

570
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:09,558
Whoa.

571
00:48:09,643 --> 00:48:11,268
You know,
seeing as we don't age.

572
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:13,604
I think you look quite good.

573
00:48:14,396 --> 00:48:16,190
Don't you?

574
00:48:20,361 --> 00:48:22,238
Nobody ever wonders
how you managed

575
00:48:22,321 --> 00:48:24,240
to be the leading man
for over 100 years?

576
00:48:24,406 --> 00:48:25,951
Oh, I don't know
what you're talking about.

577
00:48:26,116 --> 00:48:28,285
That is my
great-great-grandfather,

578
00:48:28,452 --> 00:48:30,747
that is my great-grandfather,

579
00:48:30,914 --> 00:48:31,915
grandfather,

580
00:48:32,081 --> 00:48:34,124
father, and me.

581
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,002
I'm part of
the greatest dynasty

582
00:48:36,085 --> 00:48:37,294
in the history of Bollywood.

583
00:48:37,754 --> 00:48:38,755
Pretty impressive, right?

584
00:48:38,922 --> 00:48:40,966
You abandoned me in Macedonia.

585
00:48:42,717 --> 00:48:46,178
Okay, I got sick
of moving every five years.

586
00:48:46,345 --> 00:48:49,306
People freak out when they
notice that you don't...

587
00:48:51,392 --> 00:48:52,393
age.

588
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:55,021
I thought we were friends.

589
00:49:02,111 --> 00:49:03,989
Do you know why
I love movies?

590
00:49:04,864 --> 00:49:06,448
Because of you.

591
00:49:06,615 --> 00:49:08,242
I missed sitting
in the audience,

592
00:49:08,325 --> 00:49:09,410
listening to your stories,

593
00:49:09,577 --> 00:49:10,829
watching your illusions.

594
00:49:15,624 --> 00:49:17,836
We should've
all stayed together.

595
00:49:19,838 --> 00:49:21,923
Ajak would still be alive.

596
00:49:23,507 --> 00:49:25,301
She should have never
let us go.

597
00:49:36,103 --> 00:49:37,897
This is the Deviant
you fought in London?

598
00:49:38,314 --> 00:49:39,733
It's different.

599
00:49:40,524 --> 00:49:42,568
There must be more out there
than we thought.

600
00:49:42,944 --> 00:49:44,029
Oh.

601
00:49:44,111 --> 00:49:46,113
Is... Is this a Deviant, sir?

602
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:48,115
Yep.

603
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:49,951
It's a beautiful creature.

604
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:53,579
What? This? This?
No. It's hideous.

605
00:49:53,747 --> 00:49:56,373
You've never had one
try to bite your
head off. Roll.

606
00:49:56,457 --> 00:49:57,583
Oh.

607
00:49:57,959 --> 00:50:00,003
You're about to meet
two of the greatest warriors

608
00:50:00,086 --> 00:50:01,253
the world has ever known.

609
00:50:01,713 --> 00:50:05,132
Thena, legendary,
deadly, fashionable.

610
00:50:05,466 --> 00:50:07,010
And her trusty friend...

611
00:50:07,176 --> 00:50:08,260
Door.

612
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:11,014
...a mighty powerhouse
of strength,

613
00:50:11,097 --> 00:50:14,059
the fearsome Gilgamesh!

614
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,603
Gilgamesh!

615
00:50:20,606 --> 00:50:22,191
What took you so long?

616
00:50:25,277 --> 00:50:27,196
You look younger
today, Sprite.

617
00:50:27,279 --> 00:50:28,782
I have the same apron.

618
00:50:29,281 --> 00:50:30,574
Who the hell are you?

619
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:33,078
I'm Karun. Kingo's valet.

620
00:50:33,703 --> 00:50:36,330
Oh, valet.
Like Alfred in Batman.

621
00:50:36,790 --> 00:50:39,166
Gilgamesh.
The Deviants
are back.

622
00:50:39,333 --> 00:50:41,920
No shit.
I could have used some help.

623
00:50:42,087 --> 00:50:44,546
We were attacked
by a Deviant in London, too.

624
00:50:44,839 --> 00:50:46,590
Even Ikaris couldn't kill it.

625
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:48,467
You couldn't?

626
00:50:48,635 --> 00:50:50,637
I was distracted.

627
00:50:50,804 --> 00:50:52,889
Sure, man.

628
00:50:53,014 --> 00:50:55,599
Hey, you guys wanna
try my pie?

629
00:50:57,894 --> 00:50:59,478
I'm sorry, Gil.

630
00:51:00,146 --> 00:51:01,522
Ajak's dead.

631
00:51:04,358 --> 00:51:05,652
It's true, buddy.

632
00:51:06,193 --> 00:51:07,486
We lost her.

633
00:51:39,476 --> 00:51:40,645
Sersi.

634
00:51:42,063 --> 00:51:43,940
The attack triggered her.

635
00:51:44,107 --> 00:51:46,025
She's no fun
to be around right now.

636
00:51:47,609 --> 00:51:49,070
Hey, Thena.

637
00:51:49,486 --> 00:51:51,363
Look who's here.

638
00:51:52,239 --> 00:51:53,407
Give me your hand.

639
00:51:56,161 --> 00:51:57,536
Thena.

640
00:51:57,619 --> 00:52:00,372
Everyone in Centuri-6
is going to die.

641
00:52:01,082 --> 00:52:02,125
Give me your hand.

642
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:04,501
It's too late.
We can't save them.

643
00:52:04,753 --> 00:52:06,545
Thena.

644
00:52:12,677 --> 00:52:13,928
Thena.

645
00:52:14,637 --> 00:52:17,347
We came to Earth
together on our ship.

646
00:52:19,642 --> 00:52:21,351
You're an Eternal.

647
00:52:22,187 --> 00:52:24,939
The greatest warrior
of Olympia.

648
00:52:25,106 --> 00:52:27,108
The legendary protector
of Athens.

649
00:52:28,693 --> 00:52:30,569
The goddess of war.

650
00:52:32,571 --> 00:52:34,908
Remember who you are.

651
00:52:42,957 --> 00:52:44,416
Remember.

652
00:53:00,307 --> 00:53:02,185
Thena.
Hi.

653
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:04,229
Hello.

654
00:53:04,603 --> 00:53:06,563
Hey, who's your gardener?

655
00:53:08,066 --> 00:53:10,276
This is just what you guys
eat every day?

656
00:53:10,442 --> 00:53:11,986
Yeah, this is amazing.
Every day.

657
00:53:12,153 --> 00:53:14,239
Thank you for this.
Oh, you're welcome.

658
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:15,572
Help yourself.

659
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:18,910
This one is a trio of wine,
beer, and mead.

660
00:53:19,077 --> 00:53:21,537
Made for all the soldiers
in the battle of Troy.

661
00:53:22,205 --> 00:53:23,790
That's so thoughtful.

662
00:53:30,587 --> 00:53:32,173
Should she be drinking?

663
00:53:33,423 --> 00:53:36,845
No, hers is
non-alcoholic. For kids.

664
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:41,099
I gave you
the same thing, Sprite.

665
00:53:43,726 --> 00:53:44,727
For kids.

666
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,438
I was just kidding.

667
00:53:48,522 --> 00:53:51,901
Yours is a secret brew
Odin taught me as a thank-you

668
00:53:52,068 --> 00:53:55,238
after we helped defeat
Laufey's army in Tonsberg.

669
00:53:55,404 --> 00:53:57,614
What? Oh.

670
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,741
I'm a big baby.

671
00:53:58,908 --> 00:54:00,785
Very mature.
Can you stop?

672
00:54:01,661 --> 00:54:02,996
- Stop.
- Speaking of Odin...

673
00:54:03,162 --> 00:54:05,748
Thor used to follow me around
when he was a little kid.

674
00:54:05,915 --> 00:54:08,542
Now he's a famous Avenger
and won't return my calls.

675
00:54:08,710 --> 00:54:11,045
So, now that Captain Rogers
and Iron Man are both gone,

676
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:13,172
who do you think
is gonna lead the Avengers?

677
00:54:13,840 --> 00:54:15,341
I could lead them.

678
00:54:15,507 --> 00:54:17,719
I figure I'd be
good at that.
Yeah, you would.

679
00:54:18,052 --> 00:54:20,096
Ajak didn't even choose you
to lead us.

680
00:54:20,387 --> 00:54:22,682
Whoa.
Ouch, Gil. Ouch.

681
00:54:22,849 --> 00:54:24,058
Harsh.
I'm gonna let that one slide

682
00:54:24,142 --> 00:54:25,143
because, you know,

683
00:54:25,226 --> 00:54:26,560
you've always been bitter
that I can fly and you can't.

684
00:54:26,728 --> 00:54:27,937
Oh,
so what, you can fly.

685
00:54:28,104 --> 00:54:29,814
I'm better-looking,
everybody knows that.

686
00:54:29,981 --> 00:54:30,982
Where you going?

687
00:54:32,984 --> 00:54:34,652
I'm just gonna
get some air.

688
00:54:39,198 --> 00:54:41,868
Mmm. This is
really good, Gil.

689
00:54:42,035 --> 00:54:43,369
You know,
I could sell this.

690
00:54:43,452 --> 00:54:45,246
Put my face on it,
move some units.

691
00:54:45,579 --> 00:54:46,873
I made it
from corn.

692
00:54:46,956 --> 00:54:50,668
I chew each kernel myself
and ferment it in my spit.

693
00:55:04,849 --> 00:55:07,685
Is this the Centuri-6
Thena was talking about?

694
00:55:08,019 --> 00:55:09,812
Yeah, it's a planet.

695
00:55:10,730 --> 00:55:12,357
She thinks
she used to live there

696
00:55:12,439 --> 00:55:14,359
until it was destroyed.

697
00:55:14,524 --> 00:55:18,154
Always talks about
massive quakes
ripping it apart.

698
00:55:18,321 --> 00:55:20,239
Everyone died,
including herself.

699
00:55:20,657 --> 00:55:23,326
We had an unprecedented global
earthquake three days ago.

700
00:55:23,993 --> 00:55:25,828
Oh, that's what that was.

701
00:55:25,995 --> 00:55:27,747
I thought I was drunk.

702
00:55:28,497 --> 00:55:30,708
Ajak chose me
to lead us, but...

703
00:55:31,458 --> 00:55:34,003
I can't even figure out
how to speak to Arishem.

704
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:36,047
I've tried so many times.

705
00:55:37,256 --> 00:55:39,342
Maybe you're
trying too hard.

706
00:55:40,301 --> 00:55:42,887
Sometimes, you just
have to listen.

707
00:56:30,309 --> 00:56:31,436
Sersi.

708
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:33,396
Arishem.

709
00:56:33,980 --> 00:56:35,857
Ajak was killed by a Deviant.

710
00:56:36,024 --> 00:56:38,443
We think it absorbed
her power.

711
00:56:38,608 --> 00:56:41,320
And something unusual
is happening to Earth.

712
00:56:41,487 --> 00:56:44,490
It is a side effect
of the emergence.

713
00:56:45,908 --> 00:56:47,534
The emergence?

714
00:56:48,286 --> 00:56:49,787
It is time for you to learn

715
00:56:49,871 --> 00:56:52,457
the true purpose
of your mission.

716
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:54,167
You were sent to Earth

717
00:56:54,250 --> 00:56:57,962
to bring forth
the Celestial Tiamut.

718
00:56:59,172 --> 00:57:03,843
Every billion years,
new Celestials must be born.

719
00:57:04,427 --> 00:57:07,388
I plant Celestial seeds
into host planets

720
00:57:07,472 --> 00:57:08,931
across the universe.

721
00:57:11,059 --> 00:57:14,937
The planet Earth was chosen
to host the Celestial Tiamut.

722
00:57:20,318 --> 00:57:21,903
In order to grow,

723
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,655
Tiamut needs vast
amounts of energy

724
00:57:24,739 --> 00:57:25,907
from intelligent life.

725
00:57:26,908 --> 00:57:30,411
The Deviants prevented this
by consuming humans

726
00:57:30,577 --> 00:57:33,247
until the Eternals
eliminated them.

727
00:57:33,873 --> 00:57:37,251
Now, the human population
of this planet

728
00:57:37,335 --> 00:57:39,796
has reached
the required amount.

729
00:57:39,962 --> 00:57:43,007
It is time for
the emergence to begin.

730
00:58:02,068 --> 00:58:04,028
But...

731
00:58:05,321 --> 00:58:07,073
everyone on Earth will die.

732
00:58:08,741 --> 00:58:11,828
The end
of one life, Sersi,

733
00:58:13,204 --> 00:58:15,998
is the beginning of another.

734
00:58:28,970 --> 00:58:32,849
Our universe is a constant
exchange of energy.

735
00:58:33,850 --> 00:58:37,895
An infinite cycle of creation
and destruction.

736
00:58:38,813 --> 00:58:41,065
Celestials use energy

737
00:58:41,232 --> 00:58:44,318
gathered from host
planets to create suns,

738
00:58:44,986 --> 00:58:48,197
generating gravity,
heat, and light

739
00:58:48,364 --> 00:58:50,867
for new galaxies to form.

740
00:58:55,872 --> 00:58:57,498
Without us,

741
00:58:57,665 --> 00:59:00,835
our universe will fall
into darkness.

742
00:59:03,588 --> 00:59:05,464
All life will die.

743
00:59:06,674 --> 00:59:08,426
Ajak knew the truth?

744
00:59:08,843 --> 00:59:10,887
She has helped
many Celestials

745
00:59:10,970 --> 00:59:13,723
to emerge
over millions of years.

746
00:59:13,890 --> 00:59:15,600
So have you.

747
00:59:18,102 --> 00:59:20,313
Earth was my first mission.

748
00:59:21,731 --> 00:59:25,443
I was home, on Olympia.

749
00:59:26,777 --> 00:59:29,197
There is no Olympia.

750
00:59:47,298 --> 00:59:50,343
This is your
true home, Sersi.

751
00:59:51,385 --> 00:59:53,095
The World Forge.

752
00:59:55,932 --> 01:00:00,186
It is here that I built
and programmed the Eternals.

753
01:00:36,138 --> 01:00:38,140
Everything dies except us

754
01:00:39,433 --> 01:00:41,477
because we were never alive.

755
01:00:45,691 --> 01:00:47,483
Why don't I remember
any of this?

756
01:00:57,868 --> 01:01:01,080
Because your memories
are erased and reset

757
01:01:01,163 --> 01:01:02,498
after each emergence.

758
01:01:03,624 --> 01:01:05,167
They are stored here.

759
01:01:07,878 --> 01:01:09,505
Why do you keep them?

760
01:01:10,172 --> 01:01:13,592
I keep them in order
to study the Deviants.

761
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:17,305
I created the Deviants, Sersi,

762
01:01:17,471 --> 01:01:20,391
for the same purpose
I created you.

763
01:01:21,475 --> 01:01:25,313
Every Celestial host planet
has its own predators.

764
01:01:29,025 --> 01:01:32,153
I first sent the Deviants
to exterminate them

765
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:34,864
so intelligent life
could grow.

766
01:01:40,411 --> 01:01:43,080
But there was a flaw
in their design.

767
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,624
They evolved.

768
01:01:45,792 --> 01:01:47,835
Became predators themselves.

769
01:01:49,796 --> 01:01:52,006
And I lost control of them.

770
01:01:54,091 --> 01:01:57,094
I built and programmed
you, Eternals,

771
01:01:57,261 --> 01:02:01,098
to be synthetic beings
and incapable of evolution,

772
01:02:01,265 --> 01:02:03,434
to correct my mistake.

773
01:02:05,729 --> 01:02:09,857
Sersi, Ajak has chosen you
to take her place

774
01:02:10,024 --> 01:02:12,276
as the Prime Eternal.

775
01:02:12,860 --> 01:02:14,612
Do not fail me.

776
01:02:33,214 --> 01:02:35,842
So, you're saying
we're basically fancy robots?

777
01:02:36,008 --> 01:02:39,303
And our past memories
are stored somewhere

778
01:02:40,096 --> 01:02:41,681
in space?

779
01:02:41,889 --> 01:02:44,225
And Arishem
made the Deviants.

780
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:47,813
I'm sorry, Thena.

781
01:02:48,104 --> 01:02:49,522
You tried to warn us.

782
01:02:49,689 --> 01:02:51,650
The last time
Arishem reset your memories,

783
01:02:51,733 --> 01:02:53,693
something must have
gone wrong.

784
01:02:54,443 --> 01:02:55,444
What do you mean?

785
01:02:55,611 --> 01:02:58,948
Well, that's what
Mahd Wy'ry is, isn't it?

786
01:02:59,115 --> 01:03:00,826
All this time,
Thena was remembering

787
01:03:00,908 --> 01:03:02,618
all the other planets
we were sent to

788
01:03:02,786 --> 01:03:04,871
and everyone dying
during the emergence.

789
01:03:05,329 --> 01:03:06,790
I thought we were heroes.

790
01:03:07,456 --> 01:03:08,792
Turns out we're the bad guys.

791
01:03:08,958 --> 01:03:11,252
We're not
the bad guys, okay?

792
01:03:11,419 --> 01:03:12,754
We've helped the Celestials

793
01:03:12,838 --> 01:03:14,296
expand life across
the universe.

794
01:03:14,463 --> 01:03:17,634
That's not what bad guys do.
That's what good guys do.

795
01:03:17,801 --> 01:03:19,009
Every time innocent lives

796
01:03:19,093 --> 01:03:20,720
have been sacrificed
for the greater good,

797
01:03:20,887 --> 01:03:22,930
it turns out to be a mistake.

798
01:03:23,556 --> 01:03:25,224
We have to stop the emergence.

799
01:03:25,391 --> 01:03:29,019
Sersi, we have no right to
stop the birth of a Celestial.

800
01:03:29,186 --> 01:03:30,980
There has to be a way
Tiamut can emerge

801
01:03:31,063 --> 01:03:32,064
without destroying the Earth.

802
01:03:33,149 --> 01:03:36,360
We just have to delay it
until we figure out how.

803
01:03:37,153 --> 01:03:39,363
Could Druig control its mind?

804
01:03:39,530 --> 01:03:41,783
Maybe put it to sleep?

805
01:03:41,949 --> 01:03:43,075
"Put it to sleep"?

806
01:03:43,534 --> 01:03:44,661
Are you serious?

807
01:03:44,828 --> 01:03:47,329
Gilgamesh asked Druig
to put me to sleep once.

808
01:03:48,665 --> 01:03:50,374
So I could take a vacation
to Fiji, you know?

809
01:03:50,541 --> 01:03:52,168
We're talking about
a Celestial, okay?

810
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:53,252
We have to try.

811
01:03:53,419 --> 01:03:56,756
Come on, we're not gonna let
everyone on Earth die, right?

812
01:03:56,923 --> 01:03:58,257
Right.

813
01:04:00,176 --> 01:04:03,304
I'm human.
I'm a little biased.

814
01:04:03,429 --> 01:04:05,014
The world is ending.

815
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:06,641
You need to go home.

816
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,976
And do what?

817
01:04:09,602 --> 01:04:11,228
Watch TV?

818
01:04:11,395 --> 01:04:14,900
When I could be
with the Earth's
original superheroes

819
01:04:15,065 --> 01:04:17,485
as they try
to save the world?

820
01:04:18,319 --> 01:04:19,487
Fine.

821
01:04:19,654 --> 01:04:22,198
If you want to, stay.

822
01:04:22,364 --> 01:04:24,116
Thank you
very much, sir.

823
01:04:25,827 --> 01:04:27,036
Gilgamesh,

824
01:04:27,203 --> 01:04:28,747
could you please
get rid of the saliva beer?

825
01:04:28,914 --> 01:04:30,206
I thought
you like it, man.

826
01:04:30,372 --> 01:04:32,374
We need to go. Now.

827
01:04:33,209 --> 01:04:34,585
Find the others.

828
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:36,170
Once we're all together,

829
01:04:36,337 --> 01:04:39,048
we'll decide what to do
about the emergence.

830
01:05:10,079 --> 01:05:11,957
Good afternoon.

831
01:05:13,082 --> 01:05:14,668
It's very nice
here, sir.

832
01:05:14,834 --> 01:05:16,126
Don't be fooled.

833
01:05:17,253 --> 01:05:19,338
Ignorance is bliss.

834
01:05:20,966 --> 01:05:23,384
Hey. We're looking for Druig.

835
01:05:23,509 --> 01:05:24,719
Is he here?

836
01:05:24,886 --> 01:05:25,887
Yes.

837
01:05:25,971 --> 01:05:27,304
How do you know Druig?

838
01:05:27,889 --> 01:05:29,056
We're friends...

839
01:05:30,057 --> 01:05:31,392
...from college.

840
01:05:35,312 --> 01:05:36,480
Hello, Sprite.

841
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:46,198
I missed all of you.

842
01:05:49,159 --> 01:05:53,080
Please, make yourselves
at home.

843
01:05:57,877 --> 01:05:59,671
You've given me
a lot of bad news

844
01:05:59,754 --> 01:06:00,880
in one go, my lady.

845
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:02,799
Will you help us?

846
01:06:03,299 --> 01:06:04,341
I am glad that...

847
01:06:11,641 --> 01:06:12,934
Hey,
what's your service?

848
01:06:13,018 --> 01:06:14,476
I'm not
getting any bars.

849
01:06:16,186 --> 01:06:19,523
Do you all remember
this forest? Beautiful.

850
01:06:20,692 --> 01:06:22,736
It was the last place
we all lived together.

851
01:06:24,194 --> 01:06:27,156
I've protected these people
for 20 generations now

852
01:06:27,323 --> 01:06:30,326
from the outside world
and from themselves.

853
01:06:30,492 --> 01:06:33,412
Your kind, my friend,
you will be responsible

854
01:06:33,495 --> 01:06:35,205
for your own extinction
one day.

855
01:06:35,749 --> 01:06:37,291
Don't you think?

856
01:06:37,751 --> 01:06:39,711
I think we must learn
from our mistakes

857
01:06:39,794 --> 01:06:40,920
and do better, sir.

858
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:42,964
You must not give up hope.

859
01:06:45,884 --> 01:06:47,593
Oh, no, you didn't.

860
01:06:47,677 --> 01:06:50,220
Okay, new rule, no more
possessing people's valets.

861
01:06:50,304 --> 01:06:51,765
Oh, where is your sense
of humor, Kingo?

862
01:06:51,931 --> 01:06:52,932
I'm sorry, sir.

863
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:55,309
Don't apologize,
it's not your fault.

864
01:06:56,019 --> 01:06:58,647
You are not a god.
You know that, right?

865
01:06:58,813 --> 01:07:01,941
How ironic.
Kingo, the movie star.

866
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:04,193
I've directed
some things, too.

867
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,737
Oh, yeah? Like what?

868
01:07:06,362 --> 01:07:07,947
Some Internet content.

869
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:09,699
How many views?

870
01:07:09,866 --> 01:07:11,785
I don't do it
for the views.

871
01:07:11,951 --> 01:07:13,745
Let's go.
He's wasting our time.

872
01:07:13,912 --> 01:07:16,205
- We need him.
- Ikaris.

873
01:07:17,247 --> 01:07:18,332
I missed you.

874
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:21,335
Are you gonna charm me
or threaten me?

875
01:07:21,502 --> 01:07:23,545
I mean, there's
a third option,
if you prefer that.

876
01:07:23,713 --> 01:07:25,506
It must be heartbreaking
to find out

877
01:07:25,589 --> 01:07:26,590
that you're not
Mother's favorite.

878
01:07:26,758 --> 01:07:27,801
And I'm sure
she'd be real proud

879
01:07:27,926 --> 01:07:29,593
of what you've
been up to.
Druig, this is serious.

880
01:07:29,761 --> 01:07:31,553
I'll tell you
what's serious.

881
01:07:32,471 --> 01:07:34,891
I've just been told I've been
sent on a suicide mission

882
01:07:34,974 --> 01:07:36,433
for the past 7,000 years,

883
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,938
and that my entire existence
is a lie.

884
01:07:43,108 --> 01:07:44,818
So, excuse me
for not giving a shit

885
01:07:44,901 --> 01:07:46,443
about your plan right now.

886
01:07:51,323 --> 01:07:52,742
Druig sucks.

887
01:07:52,909 --> 01:07:54,535
He does, sir.

888
01:08:15,014 --> 01:08:16,766
I don't like
this place.

889
01:08:17,224 --> 01:08:18,434
Druig needs to think,

890
01:08:18,517 --> 01:08:20,394
and Sersi wants us
to wait, so...

891
01:08:20,561 --> 01:08:22,521
we wait.
Mm.

892
01:08:23,648 --> 01:08:27,484
I couldn't recognize myself
in Sprite's illusions.

893
01:08:28,569 --> 01:08:30,780
Those were the good old days.

894
01:08:32,657 --> 01:08:35,201
What if I can't
fight anymore?

895
01:08:36,368 --> 01:08:38,287
Of course you can.
Mm.

896
01:08:38,955 --> 01:08:40,999
What if I hurt you again?

897
01:08:41,373 --> 01:08:46,587
Come on.
You know who you are.
You're Thena, goddess of war.

898
01:08:51,425 --> 01:08:52,844
Thank you.

899
01:08:54,303 --> 01:08:55,554
For what?

900
01:08:57,431 --> 01:09:00,601
For always
taking care of me.
Oh.

901
01:09:01,978 --> 01:09:03,688
I'd do it again.

902
01:09:06,523 --> 01:09:08,484
On any planet.

903
01:09:27,629 --> 01:09:29,088
I like
watching him, too.

904
01:09:29,255 --> 01:09:30,422
Jeez.

905
01:09:31,548 --> 01:09:33,176
I don't think
it's creepy at all.

906
01:09:35,970 --> 01:09:37,806
Have you read Peter Pan?

907
01:09:37,972 --> 01:09:41,100
Okay, so, to me,
Ikaris is Peter,

908
01:09:41,267 --> 01:09:42,476
Sersi is Wendy,

909
01:09:42,559 --> 01:09:45,604
you are Tinker Bell,
for obvious reasons,

910
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:49,192
and the rest of us
are the Lost Boys.

911
01:09:49,651 --> 01:09:51,152
What's your point?

912
01:09:51,610 --> 01:09:54,155
Tinker Bell's always been
in love with Peter.

913
01:09:57,574 --> 01:09:59,077
And it's hard for her

914
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:00,787
'cause she can never
be with him.

915
01:10:03,706 --> 01:10:05,208
I'm sorry, Sprite.

916
01:10:07,126 --> 01:10:08,377
Kingo...

917
01:10:10,964 --> 01:10:13,465
why did Arishem
make me this way?

918
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,011
I don't know.

919
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,937
I thought you broke it.

920
01:10:26,104 --> 01:10:27,897
Always bring backups.

921
01:10:33,027 --> 01:10:34,821
You have
a very angry family, sir.

922
01:10:35,571 --> 01:10:37,447
Yeah, it's a big issue.

923
01:10:37,614 --> 01:10:39,325
What about King Midas?

924
01:10:39,408 --> 01:10:40,534
Everything he touched
turned to gold.

925
01:10:40,702 --> 01:10:41,703
Was that you?
Dane.

926
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,788
Confucius? Aristotle?
Call your uncle.

927
01:10:43,955 --> 01:10:45,539
What? My uncle? No.

928
01:10:45,707 --> 01:10:47,876
You've always wanted to make
amends with him, right?

929
01:10:48,042 --> 01:10:50,419
Now is the time.
Trust me.

930
01:10:50,586 --> 01:10:52,171
Sersi, you're so weird.

931
01:10:52,338 --> 01:10:54,757
Dane? Dane?

932
01:10:55,258 --> 01:10:57,551
You're breaking up.

933
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:58,761
You're breaking up?

934
01:11:01,471 --> 01:11:03,099
How did he take the news?

935
01:11:03,515 --> 01:11:04,809
Couldn't bring myself
to tell him

936
01:11:04,893 --> 01:11:06,060
it was the end of the world.

937
01:11:06,227 --> 01:11:08,478
There's nothing
he could do.

938
01:11:08,646 --> 01:11:09,647
Sersi.

939
01:11:13,026 --> 01:11:14,736
I'm worried about you.

940
01:11:15,737 --> 01:11:16,821
If Arishem finds out

941
01:11:16,905 --> 01:11:18,698
you're trying to stop
the emergence...

942
01:11:20,658 --> 01:11:23,577
I'm not powerful enough
to protect you from him.

943
01:11:29,125 --> 01:11:30,627
I'm not afraid.

944
01:11:31,878 --> 01:11:34,297
This violent cycle has to end.

945
01:11:38,801 --> 01:11:40,637
Hey, stop worrying about me.

946
01:11:41,721 --> 01:11:43,056
Old habit.

947
01:11:50,229 --> 01:11:52,315
Why did you leave?

948
01:11:54,108 --> 01:11:55,234
I told myself

949
01:11:56,110 --> 01:11:58,112
something must have
happened to you.

950
01:11:58,279 --> 01:12:00,281
So, I waited.

951
01:12:00,447 --> 01:12:02,909
Days became years,

952
01:12:03,076 --> 01:12:05,286
and you never came back.

953
01:12:07,163 --> 01:12:08,748
Sersi,

954
01:12:09,498 --> 01:12:11,334
oh, I've missed you.

955
01:12:14,003 --> 01:12:16,005
I didn't want to leave.

956
01:12:19,092 --> 01:12:20,301
There's something
I have to tell...

957
01:12:20,385 --> 01:12:22,136
Ikaris!

958
01:12:22,762 --> 01:12:23,972
Ikaris!

959
01:12:29,143 --> 01:12:31,145
Miss?

960
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:32,562
You're ok?

961
01:12:33,106 --> 01:12:34,606
Watch out!

962
01:12:34,774 --> 01:12:37,026
Clear the camp!

963
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:40,738
Get behind me!

964
01:12:40,905 --> 01:12:41,906
One of them
took Ikaris.

965
01:12:42,073 --> 01:12:43,241
It's an ambush!

966
01:12:52,667 --> 01:12:54,210
Very nice, sir!

967
01:12:54,543 --> 01:12:56,087
Are you mental? Hide!

968
01:12:56,254 --> 01:12:58,631
We need action sequences.

969
01:12:59,257 --> 01:13:00,466
Sir!

970
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:02,844
Sprite, get Karun
out of here.

971
01:13:05,096 --> 01:13:07,974
How many cameras
did you bring, young man?

972
01:13:15,773 --> 01:13:17,191
Kingo!

973
01:13:17,358 --> 01:13:18,776
Come on!

974
01:13:25,491 --> 01:13:26,701
This way!

975
01:13:26,868 --> 01:13:28,036
Quickly! Come on!

976
01:13:33,166 --> 01:13:34,917
Get in! Get in!

977
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:13,664
Ikaris!

978
01:14:29,263 --> 01:14:33,059
I've fought that one before.
It's stronger than the others.

979
01:14:36,145 --> 01:14:37,355
No.

980
01:14:39,023 --> 01:14:40,733
Terrible timing, Thena.

981
01:14:40,817 --> 01:14:42,568
Thena!

982
01:14:51,077 --> 01:14:52,328
Stop, Thena!

983
01:15:27,738 --> 01:15:28,865
Let them go.

984
01:15:29,031 --> 01:15:30,575
Now is not the time, Sersi.

985
01:15:30,741 --> 01:15:33,911
Please. I know
you're better than this.

986
01:15:43,171 --> 01:15:45,339
Druig.
What's happening?

987
01:15:45,506 --> 01:15:47,508
Go!
Get to the river!

988
01:16:05,026 --> 01:16:06,444
Gilgamesh.

989
01:16:07,111 --> 01:16:08,821
A little help here?

990
01:16:08,988 --> 01:16:10,114
Stay here.

991
01:16:10,781 --> 01:16:11,782
Say it.

992
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,202
Stay here.

993
01:16:14,368 --> 01:16:16,454
Good. You're okay.

994
01:16:28,341 --> 01:16:29,676
They're headed for the camp.

995
01:16:29,842 --> 01:16:31,552
Go. They need you.

996
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:33,137
Go, Ikaris.

997
01:16:41,103 --> 01:16:43,231
Sprite, buy me some time!

998
01:16:49,696 --> 01:16:51,322
Whoa. Whoa!

999
01:16:52,531 --> 01:16:54,325
Can you hurry up?

1000
01:16:56,452 --> 01:16:57,453
Now!

1001
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:03,209
Dishoom.

1002
01:17:11,968 --> 01:17:14,762
Karun! Did you get that?

1003
01:17:14,929 --> 01:17:16,682
I did, sir!

1004
01:17:51,717 --> 01:17:53,467
Kingo!
Just go.

1005
01:17:53,635 --> 01:17:55,094
I'm not leaving you.

1006
01:17:55,428 --> 01:17:56,470
Sprite!

1007
01:18:31,130 --> 01:18:32,131
Ikaris!

1008
01:19:14,758 --> 01:19:17,176
Sersi! Are you
all right?

1009
01:19:28,187 --> 01:19:29,897
How did you do that?

1010
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:32,233
I don't know.

1011
01:19:45,664 --> 01:19:47,415
Stop, stop, stop.

1012
01:19:49,208 --> 01:19:50,292
Thena.

1013
01:20:33,127 --> 01:20:35,421
No. Gilgamesh.

1014
01:20:35,922 --> 01:20:37,214
Stay back.

1015
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:46,892
Ajak...

1016
01:20:48,517 --> 01:20:49,895
Her memories...

1017
01:20:51,979 --> 01:20:53,981
I understand now.

1018
01:20:55,107 --> 01:20:57,401
I can see what she saw.

1019
01:20:58,653 --> 01:21:00,697
So many planets.

1020
01:21:01,572 --> 01:21:03,783
So much life destroyed

1021
01:21:03,867 --> 01:21:07,077
every time a Celestial
is born.

1022
01:21:07,787 --> 01:21:09,664
Arishem used us

1023
01:21:09,831 --> 01:21:14,293
and left us to die
with each emergence.

1024
01:21:14,460 --> 01:21:16,086
We just wanted to survive.

1025
01:21:18,547 --> 01:21:20,675
And then he sent you.

1026
01:21:21,968 --> 01:21:23,637
I will kill you all

1027
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:26,138
for what you have done
to my kind.

1028
01:21:26,305 --> 01:21:29,099
You are not saviors, Eternals.

1029
01:21:29,643 --> 01:21:31,310
You are murderers.

1030
01:21:34,814 --> 01:21:35,815
Ikaris!

1031
01:21:50,997 --> 01:21:52,373
Thena.

1032
01:21:55,376 --> 01:21:56,628
Hey.

1033
01:21:58,587 --> 01:22:00,130
Remember.

1034
01:22:08,430 --> 01:22:09,891
No.

1035
01:22:11,768 --> 01:22:13,060
No.

1036
01:22:15,479 --> 01:22:17,941
I'll remember.

1037
01:22:18,107 --> 01:22:19,651
I'll remember.

1038
01:22:42,674 --> 01:22:44,592
I'll remember.

1039
01:23:27,217 --> 01:23:28,803
When I left,

1040
01:23:29,012 --> 01:23:31,848
I thought about
taking over the minds

1041
01:23:31,931 --> 01:23:34,183
of every human on this planet.

1042
01:23:35,060 --> 01:23:38,354
Violence, fear, greed,

1043
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:40,065
all gone.

1044
01:23:40,230 --> 01:23:41,398
Why didn't you?

1045
01:23:41,565 --> 01:23:44,151
Because without
their flaws,

1046
01:23:44,694 --> 01:23:46,612
they wouldn't be human.

1047
01:23:49,615 --> 01:23:52,618
Please, Druig.
You can't stay here anymore.

1048
01:23:53,369 --> 01:23:54,996
These Deviants
are trying to keep us

1049
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,831
from killing their own kind.

1050
01:23:56,998 --> 01:23:58,750
They have a conscience now.

1051
01:23:58,833 --> 01:23:59,834
That makes them
more dangerous.

1052
01:24:00,001 --> 01:24:01,920
No, Sersi.

1053
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:05,422
That makes them us.

1054
01:24:06,132 --> 01:24:08,093
Eternals and Deviants.

1055
01:24:09,301 --> 01:24:10,929
Arishem's children.

1056
01:24:12,097 --> 01:24:14,057
But you are asking me
to take control

1057
01:24:14,140 --> 01:24:15,850
of a mind of a Celestial.

1058
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:19,269
I do not have
that kind of power.

1059
01:24:19,436 --> 01:24:21,147
We'll need Phastos.

1060
01:24:23,692 --> 01:24:25,110
Well, good luck.

1061
01:24:25,944 --> 01:24:28,863
He gave up on humans
a long time ago.

1062
01:25:01,520 --> 01:25:02,814
I did this.

1063
01:25:04,733 --> 01:25:07,068
If my technology
hadn't helped them advance...

1064
01:25:12,489 --> 01:25:14,366
Druig was right.

1065
01:25:15,242 --> 01:25:17,327
Our mission was a mistake.

1066
01:25:17,954 --> 01:25:19,538
These people...

1067
01:25:21,331 --> 01:25:22,583
they're not worth saving.

1068
01:25:22,751 --> 01:25:24,585
Oh, Phastos.

1069
01:25:24,753 --> 01:25:26,212
They're not worth saving.

1070
01:25:38,348 --> 01:25:40,101
- Thanks.
- Give me a good one.

1071
01:25:40,267 --> 01:25:41,644
- All right.
- Over here.

1072
01:25:41,811 --> 01:25:42,937
And...

1073
01:25:43,021 --> 01:25:44,063
Oh, that's great, man!

1074
01:25:44,147 --> 01:25:45,231
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1075
01:25:45,314 --> 01:25:46,440
- Oh, yeah!
- Nice.

1076
01:25:46,523 --> 01:25:47,776
Good one.
All right, ready? Throw!

1077
01:25:48,651 --> 01:25:49,819
Oh, so close.

1078
01:25:49,903 --> 01:25:50,945
Daddy, Daddy, watch this.
Yeah, okay.

1079
01:25:51,112 --> 01:25:53,072
Watch this.
Let me see.
Let me see it.

1080
01:25:54,240 --> 01:25:55,784
Dad. I'm only a starter.

1081
01:25:55,950 --> 01:25:56,951
Hi.

1082
01:25:57,118 --> 01:25:59,495
- Hello. Can we help you?
- Throw it again.

1083
01:25:59,662 --> 01:26:02,749
Hey, Jack.
Ben.

1084
01:26:03,540 --> 01:26:06,920
Hey, guys.
These are my friends
from college.

1085
01:26:09,255 --> 01:26:14,260
Uh, this is Sylvia
and, uh, Isaac.
That's Isaac.

1086
01:26:14,719 --> 01:26:16,763
Isaac.
Dad, that's Superman.

1087
01:26:16,930 --> 01:26:18,014
Dad, that's Superman!

1088
01:26:18,097 --> 01:26:19,224
Jack... That's really
funny, Jack.

1089
01:26:19,306 --> 01:26:21,558
No, no! He is Superman.
That is definitely
not Superman.

1090
01:26:21,643 --> 01:26:22,811
I saw him on TV.

1091
01:26:22,894 --> 01:26:25,562
He was in London,
fighting a monster.

1092
01:26:26,189 --> 01:26:27,732
And you were with a cape

1093
01:26:27,816 --> 01:26:29,608
and you were shooting
laser beams out of your eyes.

1094
01:26:30,317 --> 01:26:31,820
- I don't wear a cape.
- Oh, sorry.

1095
01:26:31,903 --> 01:26:33,738
Okay,
well, we should
just go inside, right?

1096
01:26:33,905 --> 01:26:35,156
Can I call you Clark?

1097
01:26:35,240 --> 01:26:36,406
Is that what you go by now?
Because, you know...

1098
01:26:36,573 --> 01:26:38,201
You've called me worse.

1099
01:26:38,367 --> 01:26:39,911
- You got it, Jack?
- Mm-hmm.

1100
01:26:40,078 --> 01:26:42,038
- Way to go.
- Yes.

1101
01:26:42,121 --> 01:26:43,372
All right.
Show me how it's done.

1102
01:26:43,748 --> 01:26:46,333
Round and round and round
and round and round.

1103
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:51,547
Yep, you got it. Keep going.
Come on.

1104
01:27:00,265 --> 01:27:03,226
Yeah. Incredibly
natural, guys.

1105
01:27:05,979 --> 01:27:08,064
So, after all these years,

1106
01:27:08,231 --> 01:27:10,316
even you fell
for Ajak's lies.

1107
01:27:10,482 --> 01:27:12,652
No need to rub it in.
Mm.

1108
01:27:13,987 --> 01:27:16,363
It all makes sense why she
wouldn't let us interfere

1109
01:27:16,446 --> 01:27:18,032
with human conflicts.

1110
01:27:18,574 --> 01:27:20,243
Conflicts lead to war,

1111
01:27:20,409 --> 01:27:22,787
and war actually
leads to advancement

1112
01:27:22,871 --> 01:27:24,998
in lifesaving technology
and medicine.

1113
01:27:25,248 --> 01:27:27,250
So our mission was never to

1114
01:27:27,416 --> 01:27:30,169
make a peaceful
or harmonious world,

1115
01:27:30,336 --> 01:27:34,090
but to increase the population
at all costs.

1116
01:27:34,257 --> 01:27:37,260
Just farming humans as food
for the Celestials, right?

1117
01:27:37,426 --> 01:27:38,427
That's bleak.

1118
01:27:38,594 --> 01:27:40,096
Well, so is telling
your husband and your child

1119
01:27:40,263 --> 01:27:41,848
that they could be dead
within a few days.

1120
01:27:42,015 --> 01:27:44,100
Thought you'd
given up on humans.

1121
01:27:44,851 --> 01:27:46,811
I got lucky. Okay?

1122
01:27:49,063 --> 01:27:51,107
I have a family now.

1123
01:27:51,274 --> 01:27:53,609
They give me faith again.

1124
01:27:54,694 --> 01:27:56,696
And I see the good
in humanity in them

1125
01:27:56,779 --> 01:27:58,781
every single day.

1126
01:27:58,948 --> 01:28:00,574
So, look, I cannot help you.

1127
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:01,868
I am never leaving them.
Phastos...

1128
01:28:02,035 --> 01:28:03,119
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1129
01:28:03,286 --> 01:28:04,662
It was wrong for me
to use my powers

1130
01:28:04,829 --> 01:28:06,039
without thinking about
the consequences

1131
01:28:06,122 --> 01:28:07,123
in the first place.

1132
01:28:07,206 --> 01:28:09,751
So, now, I choose
to use my hands

1133
01:28:09,834 --> 01:28:11,669
to fix my child'
bicycle, okay?

1134
01:28:12,211 --> 01:28:13,420
Do you?

1135
01:28:14,463 --> 01:28:15,673
I don't use
my powers anymore.

1136
01:28:15,840 --> 01:28:16,966
You sure?

1137
01:28:17,050 --> 01:28:18,176
What are you...

1138
01:28:21,721 --> 01:28:23,765
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1139
01:28:23,848 --> 01:28:25,058
My child is right
down the hallway!

1140
01:28:25,224 --> 01:28:27,226
That looks like someone's
been using his powers.

1141
01:28:27,393 --> 01:28:28,435
Oh, my God.
I bet you've built

1142
01:28:28,518 --> 01:28:29,603
the perfect safe house.

1143
01:28:29,771 --> 01:28:30,855
What is this
even made of?

1144
01:28:30,939 --> 01:28:32,106
- Vibranium?
- Don't!

1145
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:38,112
Fall collection.

1146
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:39,529
IKEA.

1147
01:28:39,697 --> 01:28:40,698
Ass.

1148
01:28:40,865 --> 01:28:42,367
How did you even
deal with this guy

1149
01:28:42,449 --> 01:28:43,575
for over 5,000 years?

1150
01:28:43,743 --> 01:28:45,203
If you stay here,
you might as well

1151
01:28:45,286 --> 01:28:46,329
invite the Deviants to dinner.

1152
01:28:46,495 --> 01:28:48,039
Never mind waiting
for the end of the world.

1153
01:28:48,289 --> 01:28:49,539
He has a point.

1154
01:28:49,707 --> 01:28:51,334
No, I'm sorry.
You can't just show up

1155
01:28:51,417 --> 01:28:52,710
in my life and expect me
to go with you.

1156
01:28:52,877 --> 01:28:54,879
I'm not gonna...
You should go, habibi.

1157
01:28:55,672 --> 01:28:56,965
You want me to go?

1158
01:28:57,131 --> 01:28:58,216
You know what my mom

1159
01:28:58,299 --> 01:28:59,842
would say to you right now,
right?

1160
01:28:59,926 --> 01:29:03,930
Quit
procrastinating, Phil, and
take care of your business.

1161
01:29:04,263 --> 01:29:05,555
He's a chronic procrastinator.

1162
01:29:05,723 --> 01:29:07,684
I'm not leaving
you two. No way.

1163
01:29:07,850 --> 01:29:09,644
I'm not happy about it,

1164
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,146
but if there's a chance
for us to watch

1165
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:13,563
Jack grow up to live
a life of his own,

1166
01:29:13,731 --> 01:29:15,441
we should take it.

1167
01:29:21,948 --> 01:29:24,951
♪ Why does my heart
Go on beating?

1168
01:29:29,579 --> 01:29:34,377
♪ Why do these eyes
of mine cry?

1169
01:29:36,963 --> 01:29:42,551
♪ Don't they know
It's the end of the world?

1170
01:29:44,012 --> 01:29:49,017
♪ It ended
when you said goodbye

1171
01:29:49,599 --> 01:29:54,521
♪ Why does my heart
Go on beating?

1172
01:29:56,733 --> 01:30:00,862
♪ Why do these eyes
of mine cry

1173
01:30:03,656 --> 01:30:10,579
♪ Don't they know
It's the end of the world?

1174
01:30:10,747 --> 01:30:17,503
♪ It ended
when you said goodbye ♪

1175
01:30:43,696 --> 01:30:45,531
The Domo.

1176
01:30:46,699 --> 01:30:48,201
Wow.

1177
01:30:58,044 --> 01:31:01,130
A foreboding atmosphere
fills the air.

1178
01:31:01,964 --> 01:31:04,842
An eerie stillness
chokes our lungs.

1179
01:31:05,009 --> 01:31:06,010
What are you doing?

1180
01:31:06,094 --> 01:31:07,553
You know you're
creeping us out.
You know that, right?

1181
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:08,763
Oh! Oh, God!

1182
01:31:08,846 --> 01:31:10,640
Stay calm, T, please!

1183
01:31:14,435 --> 01:31:16,813
Chips. It's just chips.

1184
01:31:17,230 --> 01:31:18,815
As you can see,
being an Eternal

1185
01:31:18,898 --> 01:31:21,400
does not preclude you
from having human emotions

1186
01:31:21,567 --> 01:31:23,361
such as cowardice.

1187
01:31:25,863 --> 01:31:27,448
What has she done?

1188
01:31:27,949 --> 01:31:31,285
Is that... a sarcophagus
in my lab?

1189
01:31:32,578 --> 01:31:35,832
This is Makkari.
Or should I say
Miss Havisham?

1190
01:31:35,998 --> 01:31:37,708
None of us have seen her
for centuries.

1191
01:31:39,335 --> 01:31:42,463
Ready to go home?

1192
01:31:42,547 --> 01:31:43,840
Hmm.

1193
01:32:01,607 --> 01:32:02,650
Is that the Ebony Blade?

1194
01:32:02,817 --> 01:32:04,068
Excalibur.

1195
01:32:05,820 --> 01:32:07,363
Arthur always did have
a crush on you.

1196
01:32:08,656 --> 01:32:10,241
So you mean...

1197
01:32:10,324 --> 01:32:14,537
I've been waiting
for centuries
to go back to Olympia,

1198
01:32:14,704 --> 01:32:16,330
and now you're telling me...

1199
01:32:16,497 --> 01:32:18,249
...it doesn't exist?

1200
01:32:18,499 --> 01:32:21,002
That, and the world is ending.

1201
01:32:22,336 --> 01:32:25,047
At last my boredom is ending.

1202
01:32:26,174 --> 01:32:27,425
Have you seen my movies?

1203
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,386
I don't have a DVD player.

1204
01:32:30,928 --> 01:32:31,929
DVD?

1205
01:32:32,555 --> 01:32:34,098
It's all about streaming now.

1206
01:32:34,265 --> 01:32:36,184
You know, what you need
is a Kindle.

1207
01:32:36,350 --> 01:32:38,394
Do you know what that is?
It's like a...

1208
01:32:39,020 --> 01:32:40,229
You know, I just realized

1209
01:32:40,313 --> 01:32:41,814
that if you don't know
what an iPad is,

1210
01:32:41,981 --> 01:32:44,108
there's almost no way
to explain it.

1211
01:32:48,321 --> 01:32:52,659
So, how did you
end up scoring
this Emerald Tablet,

1212
01:32:52,825 --> 01:32:55,745
my beautiful,
beautiful Makkari?

1213
01:32:58,831 --> 01:33:00,208
Miss me?

1214
01:33:01,417 --> 01:33:02,960
I'm sorry,
what are we watching?
Because this...

1215
01:33:03,127 --> 01:33:04,128
Is this new?
Are you two...

1216
01:33:04,212 --> 01:33:05,213
Because I hate it.

1217
01:33:05,379 --> 01:33:06,464
Phastos,

1218
01:33:06,547 --> 01:33:08,341
I need to control
the mind of a Celestial.

1219
01:33:08,507 --> 01:33:09,967
Okay, get ready for it.

1220
01:33:13,221 --> 01:33:14,347
Bracelets?

1221
01:33:14,847 --> 01:33:15,932
You made us bracelets?

1222
01:33:16,098 --> 01:33:18,017
So, here's
a little Celestial 101.

1223
01:33:18,184 --> 01:33:20,102
Celestials are
the most powerful

1224
01:33:20,186 --> 01:33:21,854
energy generators
in the universe.

1225
01:33:22,021 --> 01:33:23,397
When Arishem made us,

1226
01:33:23,481 --> 01:33:25,274
he imbued us with infinite
cosmic energy

1227
01:33:25,483 --> 01:33:26,984
to keep our bodies
regenerating.

1228
01:33:27,068 --> 01:33:28,778
The bracelets, in theory,

1229
01:33:28,861 --> 01:33:30,821
shut down our
regeneration process.

1230
01:33:30,988 --> 01:33:32,365
And once that happens,

1231
01:33:32,448 --> 01:33:34,075
our bodies accumulate
extra cosmic energy.

1232
01:33:34,408 --> 01:33:35,409
What for?

1233
01:33:35,576 --> 01:33:38,371
Well, if the Deviants
can absorb our energy,

1234
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:42,208
what if we can absorb
each other's energy as well?

1235
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:44,877
If I can find a way
to connect us all,

1236
01:33:45,044 --> 01:33:47,004
one of us could become
immensely powerful,

1237
01:33:47,171 --> 01:33:49,882
pulling the accumulated energy
from the rest,

1238
01:33:50,049 --> 01:33:51,217
forming...

1239
01:33:54,762 --> 01:33:56,138
a Uni-Mind.

1240
01:33:59,892 --> 01:34:01,852
"Uni" meaning "one,"
"mind" meaning "mind."

1241
01:34:02,019 --> 01:34:03,020
Oh, no,
we heard you the first time.

1242
01:34:03,187 --> 01:34:04,480
- Terrible name.
- We'll brainstorm...

1243
01:34:05,147 --> 01:34:06,148
"Brainstorm"!

1244
01:34:06,315 --> 01:34:07,817
That's a way better name!
No, I invented it,

1245
01:34:07,984 --> 01:34:08,985
so I'm calling it
whatever I want.

1246
01:34:09,110 --> 01:34:13,489
So suppose Druig can, say...
put Tiamut to sleep--

1247
01:34:13,657 --> 01:34:14,782
Then what?

1248
01:34:14,949 --> 01:34:17,368
We find humans a new home
on another planet.

1249
01:34:17,535 --> 01:34:19,203
Are we building
a big ship, too?

1250
01:34:19,287 --> 01:34:20,371
Take a pair
of each animal?

1251
01:34:20,538 --> 01:34:21,831
Well, you know
what's never
saved the planet?

1252
01:34:21,914 --> 01:34:22,915
Your sarcasm.

1253
01:34:23,082 --> 01:34:24,917
Space colonization
could take decades.

1254
01:34:25,084 --> 01:34:26,460
It can happen quickly
with our help.

1255
01:34:26,628 --> 01:34:29,046
What if we
end up accidentally
killing Tiamut?

1256
01:34:29,213 --> 01:34:31,340
We could be responsible
for billions of lives

1257
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,967
not being created
across the universe.

1258
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:34,427
Boss, am I right?

1259
01:34:36,095 --> 01:34:37,847
Say something, Ikaris.

1260
01:34:38,014 --> 01:34:39,683
You don't think
we should be doing this.

1261
01:34:46,439 --> 01:34:48,816
Ajak chose Sersi to lead us.

1262
01:34:50,276 --> 01:34:52,153
Sersi should decide.

1263
01:34:54,781 --> 01:34:56,574
Forget who Ajak chose.

1264
01:34:56,742 --> 01:34:57,743
You're the strongest.

1265
01:34:57,825 --> 01:34:59,910
You should be making
this decision.

1266
01:35:00,995 --> 01:35:03,289
Fine. Just keep
lying to yourself.

1267
01:35:03,456 --> 01:35:04,832
Sprite.

1268
01:35:13,966 --> 01:35:15,217
Okay, this is not...

1269
01:35:15,384 --> 01:35:16,636
Ikaris.
Don't run after him.

1270
01:35:16,803 --> 01:35:18,805
Kingo, I...
You guys.

1271
01:35:19,221 --> 01:35:21,683
Hey. Don't sweat it.
Sprite's always cranky.

1272
01:35:21,849 --> 01:35:23,727
I used to hear
her complaining even
when she wasn't there.

1273
01:35:23,893 --> 01:35:25,227
I'm okay, Kingo.

1274
01:35:25,394 --> 01:35:27,104
If you think we should
do this, I trust you.

1275
01:35:27,271 --> 01:35:29,940
I will follow you
to the end,
like I always have.

1276
01:35:31,942 --> 01:35:33,444
What did you say?

1277
01:35:33,695 --> 01:35:36,155
I will follow you to the end,
like I always have.

1278
01:35:37,907 --> 01:35:39,992
I'm not who you think I am.

1279
01:36:19,198 --> 01:36:20,826
How long do we have?

1280
01:36:21,242 --> 01:36:22,828
Seven days.

1281
01:36:23,369 --> 01:36:24,663
Good.

1282
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:29,041
We completed our mission.

1283
01:36:31,085 --> 01:36:32,629
Where is she?

1284
01:36:32,796 --> 01:36:33,797
London.

1285
01:36:34,631 --> 01:36:36,215
She has a good life there.

1286
01:36:36,382 --> 01:36:38,467
I'm sure she's missed you.

1287
01:36:38,635 --> 01:36:39,761
If I'd gone
back to her,

1288
01:36:39,969 --> 01:36:41,971
I would only have
told her the truth.

1289
01:36:43,807 --> 01:36:45,433
She would've suffered

1290
01:36:45,599 --> 01:36:48,102
knowing this world she loves
would end one day.

1291
01:36:48,269 --> 01:36:49,437
Ikaris.

1292
01:36:50,479 --> 01:36:52,148
We have to tell them
the truth.

1293
01:36:52,314 --> 01:36:53,733
What?

1294
01:36:54,108 --> 01:36:55,652
Why?
Because together

1295
01:36:55,819 --> 01:36:57,904
we might be able
to stop the emergence.

1296
01:36:58,655 --> 01:37:00,322
"Stop the emergence"?

1297
01:37:00,489 --> 01:37:01,490
Listen...

1298
01:37:01,658 --> 01:37:02,826
Ajak, I know it's hard
at the end...

1299
01:37:02,909 --> 01:37:03,910
Listen to me, Ikaris.

1300
01:37:03,993 --> 01:37:06,705
I have followed Arishem
for millions of years.

1301
01:37:06,872 --> 01:37:09,498
And I have never doubted him.

1302
01:37:09,666 --> 01:37:11,333
Until now.
Why now?

1303
01:37:12,293 --> 01:37:13,670
Why now?

1304
01:37:18,549 --> 01:37:20,719
Five years ago,
Thanos erased

1305
01:37:20,844 --> 01:37:23,179
half of the population
of the universe.

1306
01:37:24,639 --> 01:37:26,474
Delayed the emergence.

1307
01:37:28,517 --> 01:37:30,478
But the people of this planet

1308
01:37:30,645 --> 01:37:33,899
brought everyone back
with the snap of a finger.

1309
01:37:35,107 --> 01:37:38,235
You know,
after I let you all go,

1310
01:37:38,402 --> 01:37:41,280
I traveled the world,
living among them.

1311
01:37:41,447 --> 01:37:45,034
I have seen them fight
and lie and kill,

1312
01:37:45,326 --> 01:37:47,662
but I have also seen them

1313
01:37:47,829 --> 01:37:50,247
laugh and love.

1314
01:37:50,414 --> 01:37:54,418
I've seen them
create and dream.

1315
01:37:57,338 --> 01:37:58,715
This planet

1316
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:01,091
and these people...

1317
01:38:02,551 --> 01:38:04,220
have changed me.

1318
01:38:05,931 --> 01:38:09,976
The cost of Arishem's design,
it's not worth it.

1319
01:38:10,142 --> 01:38:11,770
Not this time.

1320
01:38:13,604 --> 01:38:15,314
I trust you, Ajak.

1321
01:38:19,401 --> 01:38:21,237
I'll follow you to the end,

1322
01:38:22,739 --> 01:38:24,240
as I always have.

1323
01:38:24,406 --> 01:38:25,784
Thank you.

1324
01:38:27,409 --> 01:38:29,370
We have to bring
everyone back together.

1325
01:38:31,998 --> 01:38:34,333
There's something
I have to show you first.

1326
01:38:44,970 --> 01:38:46,638
It's just up ahead.

1327
01:38:54,144 --> 01:38:56,648
They must have been trapped
in the ice for centuries

1328
01:38:56,731 --> 01:38:58,065
and broke free last week

1329
01:38:58,148 --> 01:38:59,734
when the glacier
started to melt

1330
01:38:59,818 --> 01:39:02,528
as the Earth's core heats up
for the emergence.

1331
01:39:03,822 --> 01:39:06,156
They killed an entire company
of oil workers.

1332
01:39:06,992 --> 01:39:08,617
I tracked them here.

1333
01:39:12,121 --> 01:39:14,456
I suspected you might
have changed your mind.

1334
01:39:15,624 --> 01:39:17,627
I can't let you
betray Arishem.

1335
01:39:19,336 --> 01:39:21,422
Why don't you
just kill me yourself?

1336
01:39:21,589 --> 01:39:22,674
When the others realize

1337
01:39:22,757 --> 01:39:24,592
something is happening
to the Earth,

1338
01:39:25,259 --> 01:39:26,427
they'll come to you.

1339
01:39:27,136 --> 01:39:28,470
When they find your body,

1340
01:39:28,554 --> 01:39:30,015
they'll know
the Deviants are back.

1341
01:39:30,431 --> 01:39:33,100
It'll keep them busy
until the emergence.

1342
01:39:34,811 --> 01:39:37,146
I've been loyal
to you, Ajak.

1343
01:39:37,479 --> 01:39:39,941
Kept your secret
for centuries,

1344
01:39:40,274 --> 01:39:43,028
lied to everyone
I cared about,

1345
01:39:43,193 --> 01:39:46,740
but never have I
doubted my purpose

1346
01:39:46,823 --> 01:39:47,824
to serve the Celestials.

1347
01:39:48,532 --> 01:39:50,451
Oh, Ikaris.

1348
01:39:55,331 --> 01:39:58,167
I've led you down
the wrong path.

1349
01:39:58,960 --> 01:40:00,377
It's the only path I know.

1350
01:42:54,135 --> 01:42:56,095
Thought I'd
find you here.

1351
01:42:56,595 --> 01:42:59,015
I've thought about
this place a lot.

1352
01:43:00,225 --> 01:43:02,559
Amazing how things
change over time.

1353
01:43:03,144 --> 01:43:05,271
Maybe we're the ones
who've changed.

1354
01:43:08,191 --> 01:43:10,068
I know you don't agree
with our plan.

1355
01:43:11,194 --> 01:43:12,486
I've always thought
of the Celestials

1356
01:43:12,569 --> 01:43:14,197
like the ocean.

1357
01:43:16,032 --> 01:43:19,535
They give life and they take
life away without bias.

1358
01:43:19,953 --> 01:43:21,079
If they were gone,

1359
01:43:21,162 --> 01:43:22,664
this universe
would eventually end.

1360
01:43:23,164 --> 01:43:24,249
What you're trying to do

1361
01:43:24,331 --> 01:43:25,582
is free humanity from
the natural order.

1362
01:43:25,750 --> 01:43:27,752
It's not natural
to allow all life

1363
01:43:27,836 --> 01:43:29,545
on an entire planet
to be destroyed.

1364
01:43:30,255 --> 01:43:32,006
Arishem's way is archaic
and violent.

1365
01:43:32,173 --> 01:43:34,133
I don't want to fight, Sersi.

1366
01:43:34,926 --> 01:43:35,927
It'll all end soon.

1367
01:43:36,094 --> 01:43:38,930
Except there is no end,
is there?

1368
01:43:39,180 --> 01:43:41,683
We'd carry on
without our memories

1369
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:43,392
or free will

1370
01:43:43,559 --> 01:43:45,144
for eternity.

1371
01:43:50,859 --> 01:43:52,235
You're afraid.

1372
01:43:52,652 --> 01:43:55,280
I wouldn't mind
leaving this world.

1373
01:43:55,989 --> 01:43:57,949
I only wish that
when we do,

1374
01:43:59,533 --> 01:44:01,786
I would be able
to remember you.

1375
01:44:03,872 --> 01:44:06,332
I'm in love
with you, Sersi.

1376
01:44:06,791 --> 01:44:09,669
I'm grateful for the life
I've lived with you.

1377
01:44:15,758 --> 01:44:16,843
Ikaris.

1378
01:44:41,784 --> 01:44:43,077
Sersi?

1379
01:44:47,081 --> 01:44:49,250
It's started.

1380
01:44:51,961 --> 01:44:53,630
Oh, no. My God.

1381
01:44:54,213 --> 01:44:55,214
What about the Uni-Mind?

1382
01:44:55,673 --> 01:44:56,925
I haven't
figured out a way

1383
01:44:57,050 --> 01:44:58,635
to connect us, but I'm close.

1384
01:44:58,718 --> 01:45:00,261
- I'm very, very close.
- How much longer?

1385
01:45:00,427 --> 01:45:02,429
I don't know, Sersi!

1386
01:45:05,642 --> 01:45:06,976
Find the point
of emergence.

1387
01:45:30,875 --> 01:45:33,419
You always knew
the end was coming.

1388
01:45:33,585 --> 01:45:36,214
It must be a relief.

1389
01:45:36,381 --> 01:45:38,383
That Deviant
is still tracking us.

1390
01:45:39,092 --> 01:45:41,636
Revenge won't bring peace
for you, Thena.

1391
01:45:42,136 --> 01:45:44,347
But killing it might.

1392
01:45:57,443 --> 01:45:58,861
Ikaris?

1393
01:46:00,279 --> 01:46:01,739
What are you doing?

1394
01:46:07,704 --> 01:46:10,331
I wanted you to leave
this world in peace.

1395
01:46:11,708 --> 01:46:14,085
Without knowing
about the emergence.

1396
01:46:14,460 --> 01:46:16,045
But I failed.

1397
01:46:19,882 --> 01:46:21,591
I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you.

1398
01:46:28,808 --> 01:46:30,143
I'm close to figuring it out.

1399
01:46:34,647 --> 01:46:35,940
Boss, what are you doing?

1400
01:46:36,107 --> 01:46:37,607
I've let this
go on long enough.

1401
01:46:37,775 --> 01:46:39,694
Don't hurt him!

1402
01:46:40,820 --> 01:46:42,405
He lied to us.

1403
01:46:43,281 --> 01:46:45,033
He already knew
about the emergence.

1404
01:46:45,742 --> 01:46:47,076
No, he didn't.

1405
01:46:47,243 --> 01:46:49,954
Ajak told me everything
when we left Babylon.

1406
01:46:51,330 --> 01:46:52,331
What?

1407
01:46:53,332 --> 01:46:55,668
You were never gonna let us
stop the emergence.

1408
01:46:55,835 --> 01:46:56,836
No.

1409
01:46:58,129 --> 01:47:00,798
I only wanted to protect you
from the Deviants.

1410
01:47:01,132 --> 01:47:02,800
If Ajak wanted you
to take her place,

1411
01:47:02,884 --> 01:47:04,427
why did she choose me?

1412
01:47:09,390 --> 01:47:10,641
What have you done?

1413
01:47:11,976 --> 01:47:13,602
He killed her.

1414
01:47:16,355 --> 01:47:17,356
I had to.

1415
01:47:18,775 --> 01:47:20,651
She loved you.

1416
01:47:23,446 --> 01:47:25,114
- Did she?
- She loved you.

1417
01:47:27,492 --> 01:47:29,827
Do you think it was easy
to live with the truth?

1418
01:47:30,828 --> 01:47:32,830
To know that one day
all this would end?

1419
01:47:34,957 --> 01:47:37,293
To keep on lying to you?

1420
01:47:38,753 --> 01:47:40,963
If we gave humanity
the choice,

1421
01:47:41,047 --> 01:47:43,424
how many of them
would be willing to die

1422
01:47:43,508 --> 01:47:46,135
so that billions more
could be born?

1423
01:47:46,302 --> 01:47:48,679
We're not giving them
a choice.

1424
01:47:49,472 --> 01:47:52,058
Is this why
you're willing to kill?

1425
01:47:53,810 --> 01:47:56,479
You are so pathetic!

1426
01:47:56,896 --> 01:47:59,190
I'm an Eternal, Phastos.

1427
01:47:59,816 --> 01:48:02,860
I exist for Arishem.

1428
01:48:03,027 --> 01:48:04,278
As do you.

1429
01:48:04,779 --> 01:48:05,780
It's who you are.

1430
01:48:05,947 --> 01:48:09,075
I wouldn't change
a single thing

1431
01:48:09,158 --> 01:48:10,617
about who I am.

1432
01:48:10,785 --> 01:48:12,745
Born or made.

1433
01:48:12,912 --> 01:48:15,373
But I do not exist
for Arishem,

1434
01:48:15,456 --> 01:48:17,416
I exist for my family!

1435
01:48:17,583 --> 01:48:20,002
Then you are making
the same mistake Ajak did.

1436
01:48:20,878 --> 01:48:22,880
I found Tiamut.

1437
01:48:23,047 --> 01:48:24,257
- No!
- Makkari!

1438
01:48:26,592 --> 01:48:28,052
Get out of here!

1439
01:48:31,097 --> 01:48:32,473
Kingo.

1440
01:48:40,398 --> 01:48:42,984
You do not turn
against your family.

1441
01:48:43,901 --> 01:48:46,279
Gilgamesh died
because of you.

1442
01:48:48,197 --> 01:48:49,657
You won't succeed
against me.

1443
01:48:50,658 --> 01:48:53,244
And I will kill
every one of you
if I have to.

1444
01:49:00,960 --> 01:49:02,086
Wait.

1445
01:49:03,045 --> 01:49:04,088
I'm going with you.

1446
01:49:04,255 --> 01:49:05,298
Sprite...

1447
01:49:07,091 --> 01:49:08,134
What is this?

1448
01:49:21,898 --> 01:49:23,816
Why did Sprite go with Ikaris?

1449
01:49:25,652 --> 01:49:27,486
Because she loves him.

1450
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,741
Oh, you guys didn't
pick up on that?

1451
01:49:32,909 --> 01:49:35,077
He really fooled us,
didn't he?

1452
01:49:35,953 --> 01:49:37,246
Karun, let's go.

1453
01:49:37,788 --> 01:49:38,998
Wait, where the hell
are you going?

1454
01:49:39,165 --> 01:49:41,083
I can't help you guys.

1455
01:49:42,084 --> 01:49:43,711
I still think
Ikaris is right.

1456
01:49:43,878 --> 01:49:46,380
So, that's it, huh?
Just gonna follow him?

1457
01:49:47,715 --> 01:49:49,717
I love the people
of this planet.

1458
01:49:50,176 --> 01:49:52,470
But if you stop
this emergence,

1459
01:49:52,638 --> 01:49:55,014
you are preventing so many
other worlds like this one

1460
01:49:55,181 --> 01:49:56,766
from being created.

1461
01:49:57,475 --> 01:49:59,310
I still have faith
in Arishem.

1462
01:49:59,769 --> 01:50:02,939
But I refuse
to hurt any of you
for my beliefs.

1463
01:50:07,694 --> 01:50:08,819
We need you.

1464
01:50:08,903 --> 01:50:11,489
Even with my help,
we're no match.

1465
01:50:12,240 --> 01:50:13,908
It's Ikaris.

1466
01:50:17,286 --> 01:50:18,287
But...

1467
01:50:19,080 --> 01:50:20,957
I hope to see you
on the next planet.

1468
01:50:25,253 --> 01:50:27,838
Thank you for all
you've done...

1469
01:50:29,131 --> 01:50:31,175
...for humanity.

1470
01:50:32,093 --> 01:50:34,929
It's been a great honor.

1471
01:50:37,265 --> 01:50:39,475
I will miss you all.

1472
01:50:48,567 --> 01:50:49,568
Look,

1473
01:50:50,278 --> 01:50:53,281
if I'm gonna get myself killed
going up against Ikaris,

1474
01:50:54,073 --> 01:50:55,950
we'll need to have
a backup plan.

1475
01:50:56,117 --> 01:50:57,827
All of our powers,
even if they're amplified,

1476
01:50:57,994 --> 01:50:59,537
are not enough
to kill a Celestial, so...

1477
01:50:59,705 --> 01:51:02,248
Well, Sersi did turn
a Deviant into a tree.

1478
01:51:03,249 --> 01:51:04,333
I'm sorry, what?

1479
01:51:04,792 --> 01:51:06,085
You didn't wanna
tell me that?

1480
01:51:06,628 --> 01:51:08,337
You've never been able
to do it before.

1481
01:51:08,546 --> 01:51:09,964
I don't know
how it happened, okay?

1482
01:51:10,131 --> 01:51:12,550
And I'm pretty sure
I couldn't do it again.

1483
01:51:12,718 --> 01:51:15,261
Well, now is the time
to try, don't you think?

1484
01:51:15,428 --> 01:51:17,388
Phastos, that Deviant is dead.

1485
01:51:17,555 --> 01:51:20,767
Our plan is to put Tiamut
to sleep, not to kill it.

1486
01:51:20,933 --> 01:51:22,310
I can't kill a Celestial.

1487
01:51:22,476 --> 01:51:24,103
Sersi. Sersi.

1488
01:51:24,270 --> 01:51:25,647
We can't!

1489
01:51:31,610 --> 01:51:32,738
We can't.

1490
01:51:32,903 --> 01:51:34,447
It's okay, Sersi.

1491
01:51:35,782 --> 01:51:37,158
I got this.

1492
01:51:53,341 --> 01:51:54,967
There's no time
for that.

1493
01:51:56,135 --> 01:51:58,846
I didn't see the lies
right in front of me.

1494
01:52:00,139 --> 01:52:03,017
I'm not even sure
why Ajak chose me to lead.

1495
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,103
I asked Gilgamesh once

1496
01:52:06,604 --> 01:52:08,939
why he chose to protect me.

1497
01:52:09,357 --> 01:52:10,776
He said,

1498
01:52:11,233 --> 01:52:14,570
"When you love something,
you protect it.

1499
01:52:15,279 --> 01:52:19,909
"It is the most natural thing
in the world."

1500
01:52:22,578 --> 01:52:27,124
You have loved these people
since the day we arrived.

1501
01:52:28,501 --> 01:52:33,923
So, there is no one better
to lead us now than you.

1502
01:52:36,425 --> 01:52:37,719
Sersi.

1503
01:52:39,970 --> 01:52:41,305
Get up.

1504
01:52:49,230 --> 01:52:51,691
Ajak chose you
for a reason.

1505
01:52:56,655 --> 01:52:57,905
Sersi!

1506
01:52:58,364 --> 01:52:59,407
Sersi!

1507
01:52:59,573 --> 01:53:01,158
Oh, Sersi. We need you!

1508
01:53:01,325 --> 01:53:02,869
I already
gave that speech.

1509
01:53:03,035 --> 01:53:04,078
What?

1510
01:53:04,245 --> 01:53:05,496
You did... What...

1511
01:53:05,664 --> 01:53:08,667
Sersi, the sphere
inside of you,

1512
01:53:08,834 --> 01:53:10,334
it creates a connection
between you and Arishem.

1513
01:53:10,501 --> 01:53:13,630
Maybe I can repurpose it

1514
01:53:13,797 --> 01:53:16,048
and create
a connection between, uh,

1515
01:53:16,549 --> 01:53:17,550
well, all of us.

1516
01:53:18,008 --> 01:53:20,302
And that can activate
the Uni-Mind.

1517
01:53:20,469 --> 01:53:22,138
Great.
Yeah.

1518
01:53:22,848 --> 01:53:24,056
But, um...

1519
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:26,976
I have to take it
out of you.

1520
01:53:29,896 --> 01:53:31,105
Okay.

1521
01:53:32,606 --> 01:53:33,692
Do it.

1522
01:53:35,317 --> 01:53:36,444
Okay.

1523
01:53:44,452 --> 01:53:46,036
Don't kill her.

1524
01:53:46,203 --> 01:53:47,413
Thena...

1525
01:53:48,665 --> 01:53:49,708
Do it.

1526
01:54:03,345 --> 01:54:04,639
Will it work?

1527
01:54:09,351 --> 01:54:10,770
It has to.

1528
01:55:02,613 --> 01:55:04,406
I'm glad you're here.

1529
01:55:08,577 --> 01:55:10,162
Thank you, Sprite.

1530
01:55:25,177 --> 01:55:26,846
Protect the emergence.

1531
01:55:26,930 --> 01:55:28,682
You're really
gonna kill them?

1532
01:55:36,605 --> 01:55:38,148
Where's Druig?

1533
01:55:38,692 --> 01:55:39,901
He's busy.

1534
01:55:40,067 --> 01:55:42,152
Thena, play nice.

1535
01:55:45,949 --> 01:55:47,324
You've never had to fight me.

1536
01:55:47,491 --> 01:55:48,617
But I've always wanted to.

1537
01:55:57,043 --> 01:55:59,253
It's time to put
a god to sleep.

1538
01:57:06,738 --> 01:57:08,572
I should've done this
five centuries ago.

1539
01:57:55,829 --> 01:57:57,329
Druig's gone.

1540
01:57:58,247 --> 01:57:59,623
It's over.

1541
01:59:06,941 --> 01:59:07,942
Phastos.

1542
01:59:12,362 --> 01:59:14,157
I have to try and stop this.

1543
01:59:14,323 --> 01:59:16,034
I need to get closer
to Tiamut.

1544
01:59:16,201 --> 01:59:18,161
Keep Ikaris busy.
We've got you.

1545
01:59:18,327 --> 01:59:19,328
Go.

1546
01:59:27,294 --> 01:59:28,922
Enough.

1547
01:59:59,244 --> 02:00:00,494
Thena, stop!

1548
02:00:32,609 --> 02:00:33,987
Why are you helping Ikaris?

1549
02:00:34,863 --> 02:00:36,239
We can't
let it absorb our powers.

1550
02:00:37,573 --> 02:00:38,700
Too late.

1551
02:00:40,326 --> 02:00:42,954
Thena, he's trying
to goad you. Don't...

1552
02:00:58,845 --> 02:01:00,179
Makkari!

1553
02:01:09,022 --> 02:01:10,231
Where's Sersi?

1554
02:01:10,606 --> 02:01:12,775
You always did
underestimate her.

1555
02:01:14,235 --> 02:01:15,485
Oh, no.

1556
02:01:16,321 --> 02:01:17,947
Not so fast.

1557
02:01:22,368 --> 02:01:23,745
Boss.

1558
02:01:27,916 --> 02:01:28,917
I don't know about you,

1559
02:01:29,000 --> 02:01:30,793
but this is really
satisfying, right?

1560
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:33,296
Let me go, Phastos!
I can't let her do this!

1561
02:01:33,462 --> 02:01:34,756
I don't think so.

1562
02:01:35,173 --> 02:01:36,423
I've been wanting
to clip your wings

1563
02:01:36,506 --> 02:01:38,635
for a long time, Ikaris!

1564
02:01:51,940 --> 02:01:52,941
Thena.

1565
02:01:55,652 --> 02:01:58,570
Oh, you've changed.

1566
02:01:59,948 --> 02:02:01,573
You're broken.

1567
02:02:02,367 --> 02:02:03,868
Damaged.

1568
02:02:04,451 --> 02:02:06,287
Useless.

1569
02:02:08,538 --> 02:02:12,377
You can't protect any of them.

1570
02:02:26,473 --> 02:02:27,850
Sersi.

1571
02:02:32,604 --> 02:02:35,524
You're not powerful enough
to do this.

1572
02:02:35,692 --> 02:02:37,609
And you won't.

1573
02:02:38,027 --> 02:02:39,779
You're not a killer.

1574
02:02:39,946 --> 02:02:41,530
Maybe I've changed.

1575
02:02:41,990 --> 02:02:44,450
And is this really
who you are, Sprite?

1576
02:02:44,616 --> 02:02:47,245
Are you really willing to let
everyone on this planet die?

1577
02:02:56,045 --> 02:02:57,839
I'm sorry, Sersi.

1578
02:03:10,309 --> 02:03:12,519
I've always
envied you, Sersi.

1579
02:03:14,604 --> 02:03:16,649
'Cause you get to live
as one of them.

1580
02:03:17,191 --> 02:03:18,276
And I never could.

1581
02:03:19,526 --> 02:03:21,779
You know why I hated
living with humans?

1582
02:03:22,363 --> 02:03:23,656
Because they
reminded me of things

1583
02:03:23,740 --> 02:03:25,158
I didn't even know
I wanted.

1584
02:03:25,658 --> 02:03:27,076
Because of them,
now I wanna know

1585
02:03:27,160 --> 02:03:28,995
what it feels like
to grow up.

1586
02:03:30,121 --> 02:03:31,831
To fall in love.

1587
02:03:32,622 --> 02:03:34,250
To have a family.

1588
02:03:35,542 --> 02:03:39,213
And to know, in the end,
I've lived.

1589
02:03:46,387 --> 02:03:47,513
It's all over now.

1590
02:03:48,347 --> 02:03:50,683
We get to start over
somewhere new.

1591
02:03:54,603 --> 02:03:56,230
Well, that was very moving.

1592
02:03:56,397 --> 02:03:57,648
Druig.

1593
02:04:03,362 --> 02:04:04,906
I can't do this.

1594
02:04:08,534 --> 02:04:10,411
This is your fight now.

1595
02:04:54,956 --> 02:04:56,165
Thena.

1596
02:04:57,542 --> 02:04:58,793
It's me.

1597
02:04:59,377 --> 02:05:00,545
Gilgamesh.

1598
02:05:01,963 --> 02:05:03,005
Look at me.

1599
02:05:04,048 --> 02:05:05,341
Gilgamesh?

1600
02:05:05,508 --> 02:05:07,051
Stay here.

1601
02:05:09,762 --> 02:05:11,013
Say it.

1602
02:05:11,556 --> 02:05:13,224
Stay here.

1603
02:05:14,100 --> 02:05:15,810
You'll be okay.

1604
02:05:17,854 --> 02:05:19,689
Give me your hand.

1605
02:05:32,952 --> 02:05:34,162
Ah, it's a shame.

1606
02:05:36,205 --> 02:05:37,832
You and I,

1607
02:05:38,416 --> 02:05:40,334
we're just tools of a god.

1608
02:05:41,711 --> 02:05:44,922
Built to kill.

1609
02:05:47,758 --> 02:05:49,010
Thena.

1610
02:05:52,471 --> 02:05:53,848
Remember.

1611
02:06:24,295 --> 02:06:25,880
I remember.

1612
02:07:55,303 --> 02:07:56,763
Come on, Sersi.

1613
02:07:57,805 --> 02:07:58,889
Come on.

1614
02:10:08,144 --> 02:10:09,896
It's beautiful, isn't it?

1615
02:12:38,878 --> 02:12:40,421
I'm sorry.

1616
02:12:42,131 --> 02:12:43,591
I know.

1617
02:13:59,291 --> 02:14:00,334
How?

1618
02:14:00,794 --> 02:14:02,169
How did you do it?

1619
02:14:03,295 --> 02:14:06,548
When I touched Tiamut's palm,
I felt energy surging into me.

1620
02:14:06,966 --> 02:14:09,343
Tiamut joined our Uni-Mind.

1621
02:14:09,510 --> 02:14:10,845
I always wondered
how we survived

1622
02:14:11,012 --> 02:14:13,682
the destruction
of other planets
that we were on.

1623
02:14:14,057 --> 02:14:16,558
By being connected to
the Celestial as it emerged.

1624
02:14:29,196 --> 02:14:32,075
We became one...

1625
02:14:34,243 --> 02:14:36,996
...even Ikaris and Sprite

1626
02:14:37,872 --> 02:14:43,210
all because of Tiamut.

1627
02:15:20,206 --> 02:15:21,415
Is he gone?

1628
02:15:31,092 --> 02:15:32,342
Sprite.

1629
02:15:34,846 --> 02:15:37,431
I still have energy
from the Uni-Mind.

1630
02:15:38,515 --> 02:15:40,685
I think I can make you human.

1631
02:15:42,061 --> 02:15:44,981
All the things
you said you wanted,
you can have them.

1632
02:15:45,148 --> 02:15:47,984
But your time will be fleeting
and you'll die one day.

1633
02:15:48,151 --> 02:15:49,194
Are you ready for that?

1634
02:15:51,612 --> 02:15:53,031
I am.

1635
02:16:30,442 --> 02:16:31,485
The sudden appearance

1636
02:16:31,568 --> 02:16:34,113
of an enormous stone figure
in the Indian Ocean

1637
02:16:34,239 --> 02:16:37,533
has left more questions
than answers for authorities.

1638
02:16:37,909 --> 02:16:39,786
U.S. and Australian
naval ships

1639
02:16:39,869 --> 02:16:41,411
are maintaining
defensive positions,

1640
02:16:41,578 --> 02:16:42,579
but at this...

1641
02:16:42,747 --> 02:16:44,623
You guys did that?

1642
02:16:45,415 --> 02:16:47,543
I love you so much.

1643
02:16:55,009 --> 02:16:56,385
Are you okay?

1644
02:16:57,303 --> 02:16:59,305
I get confused sometimes.

1645
02:16:59,513 --> 02:17:01,557
Yeah. Me, too.

1646
02:17:04,143 --> 02:17:06,436
So, Dad said
you're the goddess Athena.

1647
02:17:06,603 --> 02:17:08,690
"Thena." Drop the "A."

1648
02:17:09,858 --> 02:17:11,109
Oh.
Hmm.

1649
02:17:11,567 --> 02:17:13,402
What's your superpower?

1650
02:17:17,282 --> 02:17:19,533
Um, can you just...
Look... One second.

1651
02:17:20,285 --> 02:17:21,911
Okay. All right.

1652
02:17:22,452 --> 02:17:24,163
See, that thing
is... Okay.

1653
02:17:24,330 --> 02:17:25,832
Almost gave you a shave
and a haircut, didn't she?

1654
02:17:25,999 --> 02:17:27,457
Stand behind me, actually.

1655
02:17:27,667 --> 02:17:28,877
Um, you remember earmuffs?

1656
02:17:28,960 --> 02:17:31,545
Remember how we practiced
earmuffs? Thank you so much.

1657
02:17:33,715 --> 02:17:35,341
You know that your
babysitting privileges

1658
02:17:35,424 --> 02:17:36,425
are completely revoked, right?

1659
02:17:36,592 --> 02:17:37,635
Like, it's done.

1660
02:17:38,136 --> 02:17:40,013
Thank you.
Violence... Hey.

1661
02:17:40,179 --> 02:17:41,931
Violence is never
the answer.

1662
02:17:42,015 --> 02:17:43,016
- Right, T?
- Hmm.

1663
02:17:43,182 --> 02:17:45,810
You gotta always use
your brain, hmm?

1664
02:17:45,977 --> 02:17:47,687
Like you did fighting
on the beach?

1665
02:17:47,854 --> 02:17:49,105
Your dad

1666
02:17:49,272 --> 02:17:50,815
spoke calmly and firmly
to the bad guy

1667
02:17:50,940 --> 02:17:52,150
and he had no choice but to

1668
02:17:52,233 --> 02:17:53,234
listen to me,
so no violence.

1669
02:17:53,359 --> 02:17:55,194
The kid is ten...

1670
02:17:55,278 --> 02:17:56,738
...not stupid!

1671
02:17:57,363 --> 02:17:58,865
When are you guys leaving?
When is that happening?

1672
02:17:59,032 --> 02:18:00,909
That's happening
soon, right?

1673
02:18:01,075 --> 02:18:02,285
Ah, yes, there's Druig.

1674
02:18:02,368 --> 02:18:03,912
- Don't go anywhere near him.
- Oh!

1675
02:18:04,453 --> 02:18:05,579
Yeah!

1676
02:18:07,999 --> 02:18:09,334
Okay,
that's far enough, Jack.

1677
02:18:09,499 --> 02:18:11,836
Wow, Dad,
the Domo's so cool.

1678
02:18:12,003 --> 02:18:13,630
Your dad fixed that
with his bare hands.

1679
02:18:13,796 --> 02:18:15,381
Can we go to space,
too, one day?

1680
02:18:15,547 --> 02:18:18,051
Let's wait till you get
your learner's permit, okay?

1681
02:18:18,927 --> 02:18:20,345
Hey, Phastos.

1682
02:18:21,179 --> 02:18:22,554
Take care.

1683
02:18:22,931 --> 02:18:24,514
This world is lucky
to have you.

1684
02:18:25,350 --> 02:18:26,976
Thank you.

1685
02:18:27,143 --> 02:18:28,811
I know you're not
a hugger, so...

1686
02:18:31,981 --> 02:18:34,524
Okay.

1687
02:18:35,985 --> 02:18:40,073
You think when we find
the other Eternals out there,

1688
02:18:40,239 --> 02:18:43,242
that they'll accept the truth
the way we did?

1689
02:18:45,370 --> 02:18:49,123
...because the truth will
set them free.

1690
02:19:01,177 --> 02:19:02,887
Told you that thing
was addictive.

1691
02:19:04,055 --> 02:19:05,098
Please visit?

1692
02:19:05,723 --> 02:19:06,933
I'll try.

1693
02:19:07,516 --> 02:19:08,851
When I get time off
from school.

1694
02:19:09,018 --> 02:19:10,436
Oh, wow. Listen,
it's gonna be good for you

1695
02:19:10,519 --> 02:19:11,688
to be in
a human environment.

1696
02:19:11,854 --> 02:19:13,648
You'll pick up
some social skills.

1697
02:19:14,190 --> 02:19:15,524
Oh, you didn't think
you needed those?

1698
02:19:16,901 --> 02:19:18,903
That explains so much.

1699
02:19:28,620 --> 02:19:30,164
Gonna miss you.

1700
02:19:30,707 --> 02:19:31,916
Me, too.

1701
02:19:35,585 --> 02:19:36,713
Madam.

1702
02:19:37,171 --> 02:19:38,464
Thanks, Karun.

1703
02:19:39,048 --> 02:19:41,508
Sometimes I wonder
if we did the right thing.

1704
02:19:43,136 --> 02:19:44,220
Killing Tiamut.

1705
02:19:44,387 --> 02:19:46,139
It's too late for that.

1706
02:19:46,347 --> 02:19:48,307
But you followed your heart.

1707
02:19:48,474 --> 02:19:49,934
We all did.

1708
02:19:52,145 --> 02:19:53,146
Even Ikaris.

1709
02:20:00,695 --> 02:20:02,655
Looks like someone's
waiting for you.

1710
02:20:03,823 --> 02:20:05,950
He's a lot cuter in person.

1711
02:20:08,369 --> 02:20:09,454
So, after all that,

1712
02:20:09,536 --> 02:20:11,580
you still can't change me
into a giraffe?

1713
02:20:12,248 --> 02:20:15,918
Well, I could next time
I'm connected
to a Celestial

1714
02:20:16,085 --> 02:20:18,296
during an emergence
whilst performing
a Uni-Mind.

1715
02:20:18,463 --> 02:20:21,257
Yeah. That sounds like
a "no" to me.

1716
02:20:25,219 --> 02:20:26,637
What'll you do now?

1717
02:20:26,804 --> 02:20:28,097
Not sure.

1718
02:20:28,264 --> 02:20:30,266
This planet's
my home, but...

1719
02:20:32,018 --> 02:20:34,729
I can't pretend
to be human anymore.

1720
02:20:41,277 --> 02:20:42,862
I love you, Sersi.

1721
02:20:44,405 --> 02:20:45,490
I don't care what you are.

1722
02:20:59,295 --> 02:21:01,923
Remember when we talked about
no more secrets?

1723
02:21:02,090 --> 02:21:05,093
I have no more secrets,
I promise.

1724
02:21:05,343 --> 02:21:06,844
Actually,

1725
02:21:07,011 --> 02:21:09,305
I have one I want
to tell you.

1726
02:21:10,389 --> 02:21:13,351
What is it?

1727
02:21:13,893 --> 02:21:16,395
It turns out
my family history is...

1728
02:21:17,313 --> 02:21:18,898
complicated.

1729
02:21:22,276 --> 02:21:23,653
Sersi?

1730
02:21:24,445 --> 02:21:25,947
Sersi, what's wrong?

1731
02:21:27,406 --> 02:21:28,741
Sersi?

1732
02:21:52,598 --> 02:21:53,975
Sersi?

1733
02:21:54,851 --> 02:21:56,102
Sersi?

1734
02:21:56,978 --> 02:21:59,147
Sersi!

1735
02:22:13,911 --> 02:22:17,290
You have chosen
to sacrifice a Celestial

1736
02:22:17,665 --> 02:22:20,084
for the people of this planet.

1737
02:22:21,377 --> 02:22:23,171
I will spare them,

1738
02:22:23,337 --> 02:22:28,050
but your memories will show
if they are worthy to live.

1739
02:22:29,552 --> 02:22:33,764
And I will return
for judgment.

1740
02:22:49,113 --> 02:22:51,157
You all right, Ted?

1741
02:22:52,867 --> 02:22:54,744
Did you see that?

1742
02:25:54,256 --> 02:25:56,300
It's been weeks.

1743
02:25:56,467 --> 02:25:59,261
We haven't heard from any of
them.

1744
02:25:59,970 --> 02:26:01,430
It's like...

1745
02:26:01,597 --> 02:26:02,849
they've disappeared.

1746
02:26:04,350 --> 02:26:05,685
Arishem.

1747
02:26:07,937 --> 02:26:09,648
We have to go back.

1748
02:26:19,198 --> 02:26:20,408
I feel it, too.

1749
02:26:22,576 --> 02:26:23,911
What?

1750
02:26:36,800 --> 02:26:37,884
Wow.

1751
02:26:38,092 --> 02:26:41,387
Aah! My ears.
My eyes are numb.

1752
02:26:41,554 --> 02:26:44,390
No more drunk teleporting
for you.

1753
02:26:44,515 --> 02:26:45,599
Um...

1754
02:26:45,725 --> 02:26:46,893
Hang on, hang on.

1755
02:26:52,774 --> 02:26:54,191
Behold,

1756
02:26:54,860 --> 02:26:57,445
the royal prince of Titan,

1757
02:26:57,611 --> 02:27:00,824
brother of Thanos,
the Knave of Hearts,

1758
02:27:00,990 --> 02:27:02,116
defeater...

1759
02:27:02,241 --> 02:27:03,409
Thanos' brother?

1760
02:27:03,492 --> 02:27:05,453
...of Black Robert...
Roger.

1761
02:27:05,787 --> 02:27:07,204
Oh.

1762
02:27:07,288 --> 02:27:09,749
Defeater of Black Roger.

1763
02:27:10,374 --> 02:27:11,668
The great adventurer,

1764
02:27:12,209 --> 02:27:16,130
Starfox of Mystery Planet.

1765
02:27:16,715 --> 02:27:18,925
What a pleasure
to make your acquaintance,

1766
02:27:19,467 --> 02:27:21,343
my fellow Eternals.

1767
02:27:22,386 --> 02:27:23,471
You know, you really
don't have to

1768
02:27:23,554 --> 02:27:24,723
do the whole thing
every time.

1769
02:27:24,890 --> 02:27:26,098
Everything you do
is impressive.

1770
02:27:26,265 --> 02:27:27,266
What am I gonna leave
off the list?

1771
02:27:27,349 --> 02:27:28,517
No, I know
it's impressive.
Who are you?

1772
02:27:30,770 --> 02:27:31,897
I'm Eros.

1773
02:27:32,396 --> 02:27:33,439
This is Pip.

1774
02:27:33,857 --> 02:27:37,026
And you are as beautiful
as legends say, Thena.

1775
02:27:37,401 --> 02:27:38,653
What do you want, lads?

1776
02:27:38,737 --> 02:27:40,404
Pip and I are here to help,
aren't we?

1777
02:27:45,869 --> 02:27:47,954
Your friends
are in big trouble.

1778
02:27:49,622 --> 02:27:51,708
And we know
where to find them.

1779
02:34:43,036 --> 02:34:44,494
You can do this.

1780
02:34:45,121 --> 02:34:47,581
You can do
this.

1781
02:35:08,019 --> 02:35:09,603
Death is my reward.

1782
02:35:11,856 --> 02:35:13,358
I'm sorry.

1783
02:35:15,525 --> 02:35:17,153
I have to try.

1784
02:35:31,250 --> 02:35:33,836
Sure you're ready
for that, Mr. Whitman?
