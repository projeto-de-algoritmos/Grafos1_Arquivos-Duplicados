3
00:00:57,257 --> 00:00:58,958
-Seq, I'm in.
-Captain.

4
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,293
You were right.

5
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:01,795
The skylight
was a window pane.

6
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,396
I've got
serious interference.

7
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,798
Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.

8
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,699
Looks like old code.

9
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,134
It feels
really familiar.

10
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,969
Drop a pin.
I'll signal for backup.

11
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,738
-I'm gonna
check it out.
-Bugs?

12
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,039
If the general finds out
we've been fishing...

13
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,774
A quick peek can't hurt.

14
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:16,142
-Did you hear that?

15
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:17,610
Shit. I think
our signal was traced.

16
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,813
Bugs, this feels like a trap.

17
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,047
Bugs!

18
00:02:00,987 --> 00:02:03,490
Freeze!
Do not move!

19
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,524
We will shoot!

20
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:07,927
Very slowly, raise your hands.

21
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:23,376
Here we go.

22
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,717
Hey, where are you going?

23
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,018
You were warned, Lieutenant.

24
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:34,354
I think we can handle
one little girl.

25
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:38,892
You're wasting your time!

26
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,227
My men are bringing her
down now.

27
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,395
No, Lieutenant,

28
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,498
your men are already dead.

29
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,310
Seq, you with me?

30
00:02:57,377 --> 00:02:58,745
This old code keeps crashing.

31
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,180
Your projection's breaking up.
Switch to audio.

32
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:01,581
Bugs,
this is a direct violation

33
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:02,916
of the general's protocols.

34
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,417
I know, I know.

35
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,152
But something
is happening here.

36
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,755
Something important.

37
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:09,923
Oh, fuck.

38
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,591
We know what happens next.

39
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,359
She kicks their ass.

40
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,283
Now she makes a call.

41
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:38,618
The line was traced.

42
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,954
-And then...
-Then she runs for her life.

43
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,388
Are there any agents?

44
00:03:42,455 --> 00:03:43,890
We know this story.

45
00:03:45,425 --> 00:03:47,060
This is how it all began.

46
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,596
God damn it.

47
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,130
This is where he began.

48
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,467
You're thinking this Modal
is a loop? Or a treadmill?

49
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:58,104
Some sort of sequencer
evolving a program to do what?

50
00:03:58,204 --> 00:03:59,372
I don't know.

51
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,141
But I'm going to find out.

52
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,376
All right.

53
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:36,342
So deja vu and yet it's
obviously all wrong.

54
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,611
Why use old code
to mirror something new?

55
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:40,313
I don't know.

56
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:55,028
If that's supposed
to be Trinity,

57
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,663
that's not what happens.

58
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,600
Maybe this isn't the story
we think it is.

59
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:03,036
Bugs, you have
to get out of here.

60
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,371
-It's gotta be a trap.

61
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:07,840
Shit.

62
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:46,879
Uh...

63
00:05:46,979 --> 00:05:48,748
You all carry on.

64
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:49,849
As you were.

65
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,387
I'm just gonna...

66
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,056
see myself out.

67
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:58,157
Kill her.

68
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:34,093
Oh, Seq!

69
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,196
-Why did you save me?
-You first.

70
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,031
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

71
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,666
Okay.

72
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,501
My name is Bugs.

73
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,870
As in "Bunny."

74
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,672
And tech that listens.

75
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:55,708
Do you know this is a Modal?

76
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:58,110
What's a Modal?

77
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:00,480
It's a simulation
used to evolve programs.

78
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:06,219
Do you understand
that you are...

79
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,821
digital sentience?

80
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:10,556
I know what I am.

81
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,891
Just like I know my job

82
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,060
is to hunt down
and destroy synthients.

83
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,394
Like you.

84
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,133
And yet...

85
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,203
Here we are.

86
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:25,705
Here we are.

87
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,475
The other agents
don't know about this room?

88
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,578
How'd you find it?

89
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,181
No one was ever
in the key shop,

90
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,482
so I started looking.

91
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,719
More you looked,
the more you found.

92
00:08:40,753 --> 00:08:42,355
Story of my life.

93
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:50,496
What?

94
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,233
I feel like I know this room.

95
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:05,278
Holy shit.

96
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,115
This is his apartment.

97
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,451
You mean Thomas Anderson's?

98
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,520
I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

99
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,856
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

100
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:19,292
but maybe you know him
by his real name.

101
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,127
Neo.

102
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,863
You do.

103
00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,532
Oh, okay.

104
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,467
Uh...

105
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,203
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

106
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,941
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

107
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,710
But I know he's not.

108
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,413
Because I've seen him.

109
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,450
Where?

110
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,086
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

111
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,727
But the moment
he looked at me,

112
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,429
I felt something...

113
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,467
unlock my mind.

114
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,104
Okay.

115
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,342
Something like that
happened to me.

116
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,948
I saw this pattern...

117
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,651
and it was everywhere.

118
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,655
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

119
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,291
these strange,
repeating loops.

120
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,628
Somehow I saw it
in the mirror.

121
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,464
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

122
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,338
And suddenly I understood.

123
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,874
This is not the real world.

124
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,680
For the first time,
I felt real purpose.

125
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,316
I knew who I was

126
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,318
and what I had to do.

127
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,387
Who are you?

128
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,456
What do you have to do?

129
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,694
I am...

130
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,863
Morpheus.

131
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,299
And I have to find Neo.

132
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,805
Morpheus.

133
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,376
Okay. Okay.

134
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,544
Oh, my God!

135
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,912
I have to get you out of here.

136
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,415
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

137
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,083
Okay, come with me.

138
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,318
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

139
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,687
And if you're not,

140
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:28,754
if you think that
this is where you belong...

141
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,693
You call this a choice?

142
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,261
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

143
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,862
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

144
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,531
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

145
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,499
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

146
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,901
And the woman
with the pills laughed

147
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,169
'cause I was
missing the point.

148
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,770
What point?

149
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,773
The choice is an illusion.

150
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,076
You already know
what you have to do.

151
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,917
Truth.

152
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,624
Okay.

153
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,926
There's an old building

154
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,594
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

155
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,895
The Lafayette.

156
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,530
One of the four back doors
leads there.

157
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,466
Oh.

158
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,067
-Don't fight it.
-Whoa, what's happening?

159
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,235
Keep breathing.

160
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,703
Extraction works
pretty much the same

161
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,705
for humans and programs.

162
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,542
Ouch.

163
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,643
Ah.

164
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,379
Okay.

165
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,317
-Hey.
-Hey.

166
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,219
I've never worn
different glasses before.

167
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,055
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

168
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,923
-It's gotta be...
-Okay.

169
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,663
Agent White.

170
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,965
Agent Smith?

171
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,139
-Go!

172
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,014
Seq! Can you hear me?

173
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,349
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

174
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,683
Can you get us
to the window pane?

175
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,752
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

176
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,165
That window! Go hard!

177
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,847
-What the...

178
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,088
What the hell?

179
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,273
Something wrong?

180
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,109
Uh... Just a little crash.

181
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,578
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

182
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,449
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?

183
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
-Problemo?
-He lost something.

184
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,187
Is this old  Matrix  code?

185
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,757
A little Modal experiment.

186
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,793
-For  Binary?

187
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,529
-I need a coffee.
-Coffee. Yes, stat!

188
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,731
I'm buying.

189
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,469
I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,

190
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,973
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

191
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,643
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

192
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,911
Are we all just algorithms

193
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,212
doing what we're
supposed to do

194
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,980
or can we escape
our programming?

195
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,984
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

196
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,153
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

197
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,989
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade.

198
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,258
Your game almost ruined me.

199
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,827
-So you've said.
-Yet here we are.

200
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,764
-You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

201
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,898
is it free will

202
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,768
or destiny?

203
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,341
Oh, yeah.

204
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,343
There she is.

205
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
Total f-ing MILF.

206
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,914
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

207
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,283
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

208
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,618
Maybe you should go.

209
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,754
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.

210
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,089
Best self.

211
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,261
Sure.

212
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,530
You ever talk to her?

213
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,100
Tell you what.

214
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,538
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

215
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,374
Jude, no. Stop.

216
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,176
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Thanks.

217
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,677
Hi. Um...

218
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,346
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

219
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,047
I'm Jude Gallagher.

220
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,717
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

221
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,051
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

222
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,054
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

223
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,056
-Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
-Jude.

224
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,060
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

225
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,062
He is a bona fide
famous person

226
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,530
and considered by most to be

227
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,632
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

228
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm sorry about this.

229
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,202
-Jude...
-Just talk to her.

230
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,804
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

231
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,873
Hi.

232
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,181
Have we met?

233
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,752
Uh, we both come here.

234
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,253
-Can I have your morning bun?
-Hey!

235
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,755
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

236
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,156
-Brandon!

237
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,091
Can I have one bite?

238
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,194
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

239
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,196
This is my husband, Chad.

240
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,065
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey.

241
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,769
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

242
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,937
Right. Sorry.

243
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,672
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

244
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,031
What?

245
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,808
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

246
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,817
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...

247
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,886
oblivious."

248
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,224
I always loved that line.

249
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,759
You wrote that one, yeah?

250
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,630
Every time I stand here,

251
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,967
I mean, O-M-G.

252
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,103
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

253
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,572
-Right?

254
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,675
Yeah.

255
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,677
Sure.

256
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,612
Have a seat.

257
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,816
Smoke?

258
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,152
I thought you quit.

259
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,422
I quit calling it a habit.

260
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,424
Now it's just
a guilty pleasure.

261
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,163
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

262
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,298
I know  Binary  is over budget.

263
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,667
This is not about  Binary,  Tom.
It's bigger than that.

264
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,102
This is about our future,

265
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,139
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

266
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,440
What do you mean?

267
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,143
How's the therapy?

268
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,511
Good.

269
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,679
Any...

270
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,982
episodes?

271
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,851
No.

272
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,287
That's terrific.

273
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,492
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

274
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,394
What did you say
about our first meeting?

275
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,731
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

276
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,868
But look at this place.

277
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,304
We did this.

278
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,873
Together.

279
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,709
Yeah.

280
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,745
Now what?

281
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,415
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

282
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,817
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

283
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,252
parent company, Warner Bros.,

284
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,755
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

285
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,256
What?

286
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,258
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

287
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,194
I thought
they couldn't do that.

288
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,763
Oh, they can.

289
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,198
And they made it clear

290
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,433
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

291
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,235
Really?

292
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,206
I know you said the story
was over for you,

293
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,441
but that's the thing
about stories.

294
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,178
They never really end,
do they?

295
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,781
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

296
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,185
just with different names,
different faces

297
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,890
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

298
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,894
After all these years,

299
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,964
to be going back
to where it all started.

300
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,399
Back to  The Matrix.

301
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,236
I've spoken to Marketing...

302
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,743
Tom?

303
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,378
Yeah.

304
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,479
Are you all right?

305
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,949
Yeah.

306
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,090
What were you feeling
at that point?

307
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,961
What was I feeling?

308
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,003
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

309
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,340
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

310
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,975
that has imprisoned me...

311
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,777
again.

312
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,956
Not much of a choice.

313
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,257
No.

314
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,925
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

315
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,296
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

316
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:38,964
Yeah.

317
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,199
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

318
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,169
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

319
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,004
Those facts have combined

320
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,607
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

321
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,208
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

322
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,443
with your business partner

323
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,978
and he ambushed you,

324
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,480
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

325
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,884
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

326
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,720
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

327
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,689
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

328
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,558
We've talked about the value

329
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,195
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

330
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,665
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

331
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,966
I believe this episode

332
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,835
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

333
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,572
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

334
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,709
it was for you
to share something like this.

335
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,511
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

336
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,885
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

337
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,922
Yeah.

338
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,747
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

339
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,116
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

340
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,284
to be working on a game
that was such a...

341
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,453
well, game changer.

342
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,122
Now, the packet
in front of you

343
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,024
has our focus group research.

344
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,559
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

345
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,462
including keyword association
with the brand.

346
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,632
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"

347
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,768
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

348
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,070
as you begin
working on  Matrix 4.

349
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,206
And who knows how many more?

350
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,125
What made  Matrix  different?
It effed with your head.

351
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,493
On point.

352
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,595
People want us
up in their grey space,

353
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,732
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.

354
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,178
What made  Matrix  different?
It effed with your head.

355
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,113
People want us
up in their grey space,

356
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,514
switching their synaptic

357
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,250
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.

358
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,531
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

359
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,034
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

360
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,536
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

361
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,505
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

362
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,540
We need guns! Lots of guns.

363
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,210
Matrix  means mayhem.

364
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,050
Mindless action
is not on-brand.

365
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,551
She's right.

366
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,688
Matrix  is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

367
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,456
-tight PVC.
-Yeah.

368
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,391
Ideas are the new "sexy."

369
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,241
Obviously
The Matrix  is about...

370
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,576
-...trans-politics.
-Crypto-fascism.

371
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,577
It's a metaphor...

372
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,346
...of capitalist exploitation.

373
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:31,196
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

374
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,365
Why not? Reboots sell.

375
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,503
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

376
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,407
You say  Matrix  to anyone...
You say  Matrix...

377
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,443
Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

378
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,379
...this is what they see.

379
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,354
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

380
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,590
Bullet time! Bullet time!

381
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,292
That's two words.

382
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,465
We need
a new "bullet time."

383
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,972
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

384
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,876
Revolutionize gaming
again!

385
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,503
Afternoon, Tiff.

386
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,771
The ushe?

387
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,007
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

388
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,610
I'll have a cortado today.

389
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,245
Fly that freak flag.

390
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,081
Mind if I get that?

391
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,182
Oh, hi.

392
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,185
Hi.

393
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,787
I remember
wanting a family,

394
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,155
but was that because

395
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,925
that's what women
are supposed to want?

396
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,693
How do you know
if you want something yourself

397
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,930
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

398
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,998
Mmm.

399
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,001
I pay my analyst
a lot of money

400
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,670
to answer
such questions for me.

401
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,971
Smart.

402
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,272
I should get more therapy

403
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,775
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

404
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,610
Kids are exhausting, you know?

405
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,447
No. Never had kids.

406
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,283
Oh, right, I knew that.

407
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,819
-Sorry. I googled you.

408
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,357
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

409
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,993
-Must be amazing.
-Uh...

410
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,561
A lot of hours.

411
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,697
Sometimes it is amazing.

412
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,298
Most times...

413
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,801
I don't know.

414
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,370
But you made  The Matrix.
Even I've heard of that.

415
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,241
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

416
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,476
-So, worth it?

417
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,385
Can I ask something
about your game?

418
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,720
Sure.

419
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,056
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

420
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,196
There is a lot of me in him.

421
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,868
Maybe a little too much.

422
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,605
Can I ask you something else?

423
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,907
Please.

424
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,911
There's a woman in your game.

425
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,113
Trinity.

426
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,718
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

427
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,387
God, yeah.

428
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,023
I like her.

429
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,526
-I like Trinity.
-Ah.

430
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,861
And I dig her Ducati.

431
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,931
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

432
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,937
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

433
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,138
Really?

434
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,608
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

435
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,313
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

436
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,616
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

437
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,752
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"

438
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,322
He didn't get it until I said,

439
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,424
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"

440
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,961
You know what he did?

441
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,563
He laughed.

442
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,138
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

443
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,773
How could it not be, right?

444
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,610
Made me so angry.

445
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,447
I hated myself for laughing.

446
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,185
I wanted to kick him so hard.

447
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,788
Not too hard.

448
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:53,091
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

449
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,129
And right now,
you're probably regretting

450
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,697
sitting down with me.

451
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,770
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

452
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,843
I have to take this.

453
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,548
Hi, this is Tiff.

454
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,715
Oh, God, no.

455
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,786
I'll be right there.

456
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:24,689
My, uh, youngest
stuck a Lego up his nose.

457
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,858
Oh.

458
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,327
I gotta go.

459
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,132
I hope I see you again.

460
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:53,184
There has been a report

461
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,752
of an emergency.

462
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,754
Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit

463
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,890
and leave the building
immediately.

464
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,358
What's going on?

465
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,260
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

466
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,928
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

467
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,430
Or they're just a dick.

468
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,266
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

469
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,222
Sir, this way.

470
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,229
Jude?

471
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,798
Jude!

472
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,240
At last.

473
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,310
Ah.

474
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,878
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

475
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,947
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

476
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,148
What?

477
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,650
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

478
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,219
Lightning,
thunder and theater.

479
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,154
At last.

480
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,657
All these years later,
here's me,

481
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,992
strolling out
of a toilet stall.

482
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,227
Tragedy or farce?

483
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,929
I know you.

484
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,997
Not every day
you meet your maker.

485
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,265
This can't be happening.

486
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, most definitely is.

487
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,569
You can't be
a character I coded.

488
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,672
100% natural.

489
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,347
How?

490
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,616
All the explanation you need.

491
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,454
Oh.

492
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,689
No.

493
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,524
No, no, no.

494
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

495
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,128
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

496
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:48,533
It was a test. An experiment.

497
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,035
An experiment?

498
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,539
You put me
in a tiny-ass Modal,

499
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,007
left me to bang my head till

500
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,343
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

501
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,944
as an experiment.

502
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,013
-The exit's breaking down.
-He hasn't taken the pill.

503
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,448
What? There's no time.

504
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,550
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

505
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,119
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

506
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,056
Still open.

507
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,560
This... This can't be real.

508
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,495
Target acquired.
We got him.

509
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,404
This isn't happening.

510
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,973
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

511
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,241
Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

512
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,892
This can't be happening.

513
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,764
Freeze! Don't move!

514
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,874
Neo!

515
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,190
Oh, my God!

516
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,992
Neo!

517
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,100
Mr. Anderson!

518
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,168
No!

519
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,303
It can't be.

520
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,947
I've missed you.

521
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,864
It's in my mind.

522
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,366
It's in my mind.

523
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,042
Can you hear me, Thomas?

524
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,113
Follow my voice.

525
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,884
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

526
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,320
The bell.

527
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,224
Do you hear the bell?

528
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,697
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

529
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,634
You must have walked.

530
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,902
I heard Deja Vu outside,

531
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,236
opened my door,
and there you were.

532
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,411
You feel like
you can talk about it?

533
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,746
When we started
working together,

534
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,581
you had lost your capacity

535
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,217
to discern reality
from fiction.

536
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,487
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

537
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,856
You said you wanted
to fly away.

538
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,939
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

539
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

540
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,909
Can you tell me
how it started?

541
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,613
He texted me.

542
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,115
Who?

543
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,684
Morpheus.

544
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,851
Ah.

545
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,921
So, he's back.

546
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,190
It wasn't actually him.

547
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,628
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

548
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,897
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

549
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,966
came to help you escape

550
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,703
from a virtual reality
called  The Matrix.

551
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,781
Am I crazy?

552
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,317
We don't use that word
in here.

553
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,320
What word should I use?

554
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,757
What word explains
what is happening to me?

555
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,492
Can I see the texts?

556
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,496
They were erased.

557
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,105
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

558
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,140
what do you think
we'd find there?

559
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,275
Nothing.

560
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,079
Because there was no attack.

561
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,849
No one was killed.

562
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,918
No one texted.

563
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,021
My mind made it all up.

564
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,125
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

565
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,693
Is that what you believe?

566
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,362
It felt real.

567
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,197
Of course.

568
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,200
It was your great ambition
to make a game

569
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,670
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

570
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,204
To achieve this goal,

571
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,774
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

572
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,109
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

573
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,378
cast him as your nemesis.

574
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,113
A married woman named Tiffany

575
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,517
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.

576
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,788
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your  Matrix.

577
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,656
There's nothing wrong
with that.

578
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,191
It's what artists do.

579
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,661
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

580
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,064
endanger us or other people.

581
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,702
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

582
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,170
do we, Thomas?

583
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,380
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

584
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,882
-Who are you?
-My name is Trinity.

585
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,584
No one can tell you
you're in love.

586
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,187
You just know it,
through and through.

587
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,756
Balls to bones.

588
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,658
You feel this?

589
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,061
I'm never letting go.

590
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,771
You have
to let it all go, Neo.

591
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,240
Free your mind.

592
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,460
Huh.

593
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,562
Looks easy enough.

594
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,038
"Free my mind." Shit.

595
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,246
Okay.

596
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,747
Free my mind.

597
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,498
I fly...

598
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,334
or I fall.

599
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,410
Who the hell are you?

600
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,346
You won't remember me,

601
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,683
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

602
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,152
when you leapt off
another roof.

603
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,155
Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,

604
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,957
pretending my life...

605
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:04,161
until I looked up
and I saw you.

606
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,764
It was a different you,
but I saw

607
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,300
the real you,

608
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,168
just a second before...

609
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,704
you leapt.

610
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,277
And you never fell.

611
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,718
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

612
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,320
Yeah.

613
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,356
That'll be Jude.

614
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,791
He's not your friend.

615
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,326
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

616
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,460
He's on his way here,

617
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,362
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

618
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,065
Jude.

619
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,566
Bro, I've been calling you
all night.

620
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,368
We have a major problemo.

621
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,505
Are you alone?

622
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,043
That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.

623
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,412
They don't look like
typical Agents.

624
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,914
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

625
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,148
which means they're everywhere

626
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,484
and you never know
who to trust.

627
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,319
Why should I trust you?

628
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,491
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

629
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,260
I will be caught and killed

630
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,561
and you will be put right back

631
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,896
on that treadmill
they designed for you,

632
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,097
just like they did
the last time

633
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,365
you tried to leap
your way out.

634
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,102
I know why you left
your Modal open.

635
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,671
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

636
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,773
And it's because of him
that we were able
to get to you.

637
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,742
I know these things
the same way

638
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,578
that I knew one day
I would find you.

639
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,281
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

640
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,253
If you want the truth, Neo,

641
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,523
you're going
to have to follow me.

642
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,059
Okay.

643
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,214
-Where are we?
-Tokyo.

644
00:43:04,281 --> 00:43:06,116
A moving portal
makes it harder to track us.

645
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:08,819
-Seq is the best of them.
-Portal's clean.

646
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:10,321
Reading our shadows.

647
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:14,325
I don't remember this.

648
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,727
We don't have to
run to phone booths
anymore, either.

649
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:27,771
Door's on your right.

650
00:43:41,986 --> 00:43:44,355
Set and setting, right?

651
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,756
Oh, no.

652
00:43:45,823 --> 00:43:47,291
It's all about set

653
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,360
and setting.

654
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,595
After our first contact
went so badly,

655
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,530
we thought elements
from your past

656
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,132
might help ease you
into the present.

657
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,035
Nothing comforts anxiety like

658
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,536
a little nostalgia.

659
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:01,972
This is footage
from your game.

660
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,181
Time is
always against us,

661
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:14,118
etcetera, etcetera.

662
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:16,453
No one can be told

663
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,823
what the Matrix is,
blah, blah, blah.

664
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:24,361
You gotta see it
to believe it.

665
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,566
Time to fly.

666
00:44:31,635 --> 00:44:33,070
Wait.

667
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:34,405
If this is real,

668
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,141
if I haven't lost my mind,
does that mean

669
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:40,210
this happened?

670
00:44:49,053 --> 00:44:50,688
But if it did...

671
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:56,360
then we died.

672
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,362
Obviously not.

673
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,863
Why the Machines
kept you alive

674
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,833
and why they went
to such lengths to hide you

675
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,735
are questions
we don't have answers to.

676
00:45:04,835 --> 00:45:06,403
Hide me?

677
00:45:06,503 --> 00:45:10,774
I've been at a company making
a game called  The Matrix.

678
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,444
Doesn't seem like they were
trying to hide anything.

679
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,079
We've been tracking
that company for years.

680
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:17,948
We screened every
Thomas Anderson we found.

681
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,616
What we didn't understand

682
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,219
was that they could
alter your DSI.

683
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,054
Pods generate
your digital self-image

684
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,623
through a feedback system
called Semblance.

685
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,726
This is how
you look to yourself.

686
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:32,529
Somehow they were able
to alter your DSI loop.

687
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,099
This is how
everyone else sees you.

688
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:51,148
Twenty years?

689
00:45:52,449 --> 00:45:55,986
Why did it take 20 years
to find me?

690
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:57,921
It took a lot longer
than that.

691
00:45:57,988 --> 00:45:59,990
It's been over 60 years
since you and Trinity

692
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,825
flew to one
of the Machine Cities.

693
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:03,494
What?

694
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,796
There's so much we don't know.

695
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,631
Like why you've barely aged,

696
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,933
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

697
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,335
But based on
what we do know,

698
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,770
it appears no one found you

699
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,671
because you didn't
want to be found.

700
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,508
-That's not true.
-Maybe it isn't.

701
00:46:17,608 --> 00:46:18,809
Maybe there's no foundation

702
00:46:18,909 --> 00:46:20,077
to the rumors
that you disappeared,

703
00:46:20,144 --> 00:46:21,311
because you were working

704
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:22,813
with the Machines
from the beginning.

705
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,014
Morpheus, stop.

706
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,251
All I'm saying is
this is the moment

707
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:29,853
for you to show us
what is real.

708
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,156
If you want out,

709
00:46:32,256 --> 00:46:33,624
you'll take this pill.

710
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,528
But if you are
where you belong,

711
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,797
you can go back to this.

712
00:46:39,863 --> 00:46:41,198
Every day.

713
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,935
Over and over forever.

714
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,606
Fuck.

715
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,818
Keep the loop tight.

716
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:14,398
Cybebe needs
that tower pin.

717
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:16,366
I got a signal. It's faint.

718
00:47:16,466 --> 00:47:17,901
It's definitely off-grid.

719
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:27,211
Captain. I'm tracking
a whole lot of weird.

720
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,745
-What?
-It's some kind of graft.

721
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:36,320
Thomas?

722
00:47:37,487 --> 00:47:39,256
Oh, God.

723
00:47:39,890 --> 00:47:41,592
Oh, no.

724
00:47:42,926 --> 00:47:45,095
-We got company.
-How'd they find us?

725
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:49,266
Thomas, none of this is real.

726
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:53,570
You are in the midst
of a serious psychotic break.

727
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:55,739
-Lexy?
-Almost there.

728
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,908
Thomas?

729
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,844
Thomas, please.
This is not a game.

730
00:48:00,911 --> 00:48:02,412
Feel my hand.

731
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:03,714
This is what is real.

732
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:08,518
Stay with me.

733
00:48:08,585 --> 00:48:10,220
No. No.

734
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:14,291
Stay with me.

735
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,961
Neo!

736
00:48:21,698 --> 00:48:22,699
Morpheus!

737
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:25,636
Let's go, let's go!

738
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:58,135
-Bots are being activated.
-It's a swarm.

739
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:23,360
Come on!

740
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,328
I got a hack
in the bathroom. Hurry!

741
00:49:58,395 --> 00:49:59,396
Yes.

742
00:50:00,197 --> 00:50:01,198
Come on!

743
00:50:03,233 --> 00:50:04,301
Seq, where?

744
00:50:06,403 --> 00:50:08,071
-That mirror.
-What?

745
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,906
-We'll never fit.
-You gotta fit,

746
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,375
'cause I don't have
another way off this train.

747
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:12,476
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

748
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,012
No, no, no.

749
00:50:15,078 --> 00:50:16,246
Think "perspective."

750
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:18,148
Closer you are,
bigger it gets.

751
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,353
Okay, come on.

752
00:50:24,588 --> 00:50:25,756
In you go.

753
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,005
Trinity.

754
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:28,345
No!

755
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:52,195
Welcome back
to the real world.

756
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:01,905
Trinity.

757
00:54:01,972 --> 00:54:03,106
-What's up, Doc?
-His vital systems

758
00:54:03,206 --> 00:54:04,641
have been
meticulously maintained,

759
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:06,610
but it doesn't look good.

760
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:14,384
-We're losing him.
-Cold boot could shock him.

761
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:15,986
Do it.

762
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,600
I remember this.

763
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,804
The Construct.

764
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,241
In between everything

765
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:40,443
and nothing.

766
00:54:40,510 --> 00:54:42,178
Welcome to the Crib.

767
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:45,815
I've been chilling here
in the ship network...

768
00:54:49,185 --> 00:54:50,820
learning all about you.

769
00:54:55,525 --> 00:54:56,660
And me.

770
00:55:00,497 --> 00:55:04,334
Careful. It'll do your head in.

771
00:55:04,434 --> 00:55:07,971
Are memories turned
into fiction any less real?

772
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,377
Is reality based in memory
nothing but fiction?

773
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,714
As to my role in all this,
my best guess

774
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,115
is that you wrote me

775
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:21,217
as an algorithmic reflection
of two forces

776
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:23,820
that helped you become you,

777
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:27,357
Morpheus and Agent Smith.

778
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:28,558
A combo pack

779
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,161
of counterprogramming
that was...

780
00:55:33,963 --> 00:55:37,801
Let's just say, more than
a little bit crazy-making.

781
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,804
But it worked
because here we are.

782
00:55:41,838 --> 00:55:43,406
Now, for the bad news.

783
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,709
Your brain
is hooked on this shit

784
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:48,678
the Matrix has been
force-feeding you for years.

785
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:50,413
Hooked bad.

786
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,015
You're going through
major withdrawals.

787
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:55,318
Docbots are giving you
crap odds for surviving.

788
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,654
But, see,
they don't know you like I do.

789
00:56:00,523 --> 00:56:02,726
I know exactly what you need.

790
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,282
You gotta be kidding.

791
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:27,417
Uh-uh.

792
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,220
No joke.

793
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:34,424
Could be this is the first day
of the rest of your life.

794
00:56:34,524 --> 00:56:36,359
But if you want it...

795
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,297
you gotta fight for it.

796
00:56:42,432 --> 00:56:45,402
No. I'm done fighting.

797
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,437
Are you?

798
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,182
What the hell is he doing?

799
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:36,152
Oh, yeah.
They taught you good.

800
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:44,861
Made you believe their world
was all you deserved.

801
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,863
But some part of you knew
that was a lie.

802
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:49,699
Some part of you remembered
what was real.

803
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,636
You don't know me.

804
00:57:54,270 --> 00:57:55,305
No?

805
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:02,278
Ooh.

806
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,582
I know you, because I know

807
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,584
the only thing
that still matters to you.

808
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,854
I know it's why you're here,
why you're still fighting

809
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:46,523
and why you will
never give up.

810
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,038
Come on, Neo!

811
00:59:03,439 --> 00:59:04,674
This is it.

812
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:08,378
This is your last chance.

813
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:17,787
You gotta fight
for your goddamn life

814
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,222
if you want to see
Trinity again.

815
00:59:24,127 --> 00:59:25,528
Come on, Neo! Fight for her!

816
00:59:28,131 --> 00:59:30,767
-Holy shit.
-Fight for her!

817
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:24,520
-Hey.
-Hey.

818
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:27,957
Mind if I...

819
01:00:41,137 --> 01:00:42,639
How are you doing?

820
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:46,309
If this plug is actually real,

821
01:00:48,277 --> 01:00:50,613
that means
they took my life...

822
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:55,518
and turned it
into a video game.

823
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,289
How am I doing?

824
01:01:01,224 --> 01:01:03,292
I don't know.

825
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,528
I don't even know how to know.

826
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:08,131
That's it, isn't it?

827
01:01:09,632 --> 01:01:11,834
If we don't know
what's real...

828
01:01:13,903 --> 01:01:15,038
we can't resist.

829
01:01:17,974 --> 01:01:19,409
They took your story,

830
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,010
something that meant

831
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,347
so much to people like me,

832
01:01:25,982 --> 01:01:28,651
and turned it
into something trivial.

833
01:01:30,420 --> 01:01:32,221
That's what the Matrix does.

834
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:35,258
It weaponizes every idea.

835
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:37,427
Every dream.

836
01:01:38,928 --> 01:01:40,730
Everything
that's important to us.

837
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,501
Where better to bury truth
than inside something

838
01:01:45,568 --> 01:01:48,604
as ordinary as a video game?

839
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,707
That sounds like the Oracle.

840
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,910
Heard so much about her.

841
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,247
She was gone
before I was free.

842
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,284
Gone?

843
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:04,220
When this new version
of the Matrix was uploaded,

844
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,256
there was a purge.

845
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:15,898
They promised peace
and they gave us purge.

846
01:02:17,366 --> 01:02:18,801
No.

847
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,603
No, there was peace.

848
01:02:22,038 --> 01:02:27,143
You made it possible,
and it changed everything.

849
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:30,747
Doesn't feel like
it changed anything.

850
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:34,050
The Matrix is
the same or worse.

851
01:02:34,117 --> 01:02:36,319
And I'm back where I started.

852
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:41,557
It feels like
everything I did,

853
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,093
everything we did...

854
01:02:50,099 --> 01:02:52,301
...like none of it mattered.

855
01:02:54,504 --> 01:02:56,172
All of it mattered.

856
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,442
I can show you.

857
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,687
This is my crew.

858
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,993
Our operator, Seq.

859
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:23,099
Sequoia. But everybody
calls me Seq.

860
01:03:23,166 --> 01:03:24,634
Nice to meet you.

861
01:03:25,668 --> 01:03:27,703
Dad loved redwoods.

862
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,038
When he escaped the Matrix

863
01:03:29,138 --> 01:03:30,673
and found out
they no longer existed,

864
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:32,275
it almost killed him.

865
01:03:32,341 --> 01:03:33,543
Lucky, he met Mom

866
01:03:34,443 --> 01:03:36,045
and here I am.

867
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,849
This is Lexy,
Berg and Ellster.

868
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:41,717
Hi.

869
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:44,387
You knew my grandfather,
Captain Roland.

870
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,956
Roland was your grandfather?

871
01:03:47,723 --> 01:03:48,825
He always laughed,

872
01:03:48,891 --> 01:03:49,859
joking how he never
believed in you.

873
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,395
But, in private, he said that

874
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:54,630
you freed his mind
a second time.

875
01:03:54,697 --> 01:03:56,732
Uh, not to fanboy out here,

876
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,835
but this is kind
of a huge moment for me.

877
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:01,404
Berg is our resident
Neo-ologist.

878
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,705
A what?

879
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:05,842
There's a lot of people
out there like me

880
01:04:05,908 --> 01:04:08,244
who are a little bit
obsessed with your life.

881
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,512
I would never have recognized

882
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,713
your Modal
if it weren't for him.

883
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:12,048
Whenever
you're feeling up for it,

884
01:04:12,148 --> 01:04:14,083
I've got, like,
a million questions.

885
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,652
Me too. Starting with them.

886
01:04:17,987 --> 01:04:19,021
It's okay.

887
01:04:19,755 --> 01:04:21,023
Come meet him.

888
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:22,391
This is Cybebe.

889
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:23,893
That's Octacles.

890
01:04:23,993 --> 01:04:26,662
-That's Lumin8.

891
01:04:26,729 --> 01:04:28,998
Machines are on our side now?

892
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:30,266
They are synthients.

893
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,034
It's a word
they prefer to "Machines."

894
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,436
Your contact
with the Synthient City

895
01:04:33,536 --> 01:04:35,905
had a huge impact
on their world.

896
01:04:36,005 --> 01:04:37,106
That's what I meant.

897
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:38,441
What you changed

898
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:40,109
that nobody believed
could ever be changed.

899
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,547
The meaning of "our side."

900
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:50,186
Cybebe and Octacles
risked their lives

901
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,420
to help get you out.

902
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:53,890
Thank you.

903
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:56,459
But why?

904
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,095
Not all seek to control.

905
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,197
Just as not all
wish to be free.

906
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,233
What is that?

907
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,602
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

908
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,804
It gives programs
access to this world.

909
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,106
Within limits.

910
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,209
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

911
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:14,810
Morpheus.

912
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,945
Thank you.

913
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,446
It was my honor.

914
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,483
Wow.

915
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,751
-How does it work?

916
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,319
Paramagnetic oscillation.

917
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,587
If you want,

918
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,922
I can download
the codex manual for you.

919
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,424
-Sure.
-Downloading used to be fun.

920
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,893
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

921
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,662
Can I ask them something?

922
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,834
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

923
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,072
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

924
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,608
It could be Trinity.

925
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,010
It's her.

926
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,180
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

927
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,183
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

928
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,952
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

929
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,120
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

930
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,589
We burned
our one shot for you.

931
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,692
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

932
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,827
we have no idea how to do it.

933
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,928
Yet.

934
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,200
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

935
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,335
but we did.

936
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,672
Okay.

937
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,875
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

938
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,613
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

939
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,049
We're here.

940
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,184
Zion?

941
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,727
Have a seat.

942
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,563
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

943
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,630
Quite a few synthients

944
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,165
deserve that title before me.

945
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:44,400
Mnemosyne,  you are cleared

946
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,868
for landing. Welcome home.

947
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,636
Thank you, Control.

948
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,305
Um, we're about to crash.

949
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:57,480
General realized we were

950
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:59,582
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...

951
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,817
we just got better
at hiding from them.

952
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,990
Welcome to Io.

953
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,027
Io.

954
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,202
Wow. That looks real.

955
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,271
Bio-sky.

956
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,210
Works kind of like
grow lights.

957
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,945
It's way more complex
than that.

958
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,515
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

959
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,918
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

960
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,354
Plus...

961
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,956
it is pretty to look at.

962
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,858
As opposed to that.

963
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,729
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

964
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,415
God damn.

965
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,717
It is you.

966
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,753
Niobe?

967
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,158
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

968
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,929
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

969
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,665
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

970
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,667
Neither did I.

971
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,102
I told you he was alive.

972
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,137
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

973
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,839
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

974
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,575
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

975
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,510
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

976
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,078
and I was afraid
we'd lose him.

977
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,814
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

978
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:41,750
We found The One.

979
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,287
I don't believe in The One.

980
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,657
I never did.

981
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,426
No?

982
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,028
Me neither.

983
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,498
But there was a time

984
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,267
when you trusted me
with your ship,

985
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,136
against the Council's orders.

986
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,304
The world was different then.

987
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,774
We were different.

988
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,211
Report to the docks.

989
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,013
Scrub down the  Mnemosyne.

990
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,382
Transfer your access codes.

991
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,884
You are done, Captain.

992
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,395
We need to talk.

993
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,303
When word first came

994
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,639
that it actually
might be you...

995
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:44,180
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

996
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,023
It is nice to see you.

997
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,825
-It's good to see you too.

998
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,434
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

999
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,504
Yes.

1000
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,339
A lot has changed.

1001
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,776
Except maybe you.

1002
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,113
You remember this?

1003
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,957
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

1004
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,959
the Matrix pumps
into your head

1005
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,860
until you unplug.

1006
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,697
Yeah.

1007
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,700
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1008
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,969
Takes over every damn thing,

1009
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,770
just like the Matrix.

1010
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:44,440
War.

1011
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,777
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

1012
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,881
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,

1013
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:56,619
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

1014
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,156
But then, they left.

1015
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,827
They said you saved us.

1016
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,095
I didn't believe it.

1017
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,498
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1018
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,433
But then,

1019
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,238
I would wake up to this...

1020
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,677
silence.

1021
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,682
I'm ashamed of it now.

1022
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,786
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

1023
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:34,123
a world without war
was possible.

1024
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,526
You gave me that.

1025
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,496
You gave that gift to us all.

1026
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:44,266
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1027
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,704
Come help me get up.

1028
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,539
Let's take a walk.

1029
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,665
Oh! Beautiful.

1030
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,703
This is Freya, head of botany.

1031
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,073
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1032
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:28,177
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

1033
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,913
Nothing travels
faster than light,

1034
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,247
except gossip.

1035
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,051
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1036
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,254
A strawberry?

1037
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,056
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

1038
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,559
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

1039
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:45,060
And they grow here?

1040
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,762
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

1041
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,398
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

1042
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,233
-We're getting there.

1043
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,702
Go ahead. Try it.

1044
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,412
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1045
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,414
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

1046
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,883
That slop
that tasted like rust.

1047
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,088
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1048
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,790
Why?

1049
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,459
Because we needed synthients

1050
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,528
and DI like him.

1051
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,965
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1052
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,434
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1053
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:29,405
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1054
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:32,474
This city was built by us

1055
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,243
and them.

1056
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,450
What happened to Zion?

1057
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,953
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1058
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,392
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1059
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:54,163
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1060
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:58,000
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1061
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,336
For the first time,

1062
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,640
we saw machines at war
with one other.

1063
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:11,647
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1064
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,285
That was the last
we heard from her.

1065
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,323
Morpheus.

1066
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:25,794
After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1067
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:28,764
High Chair of the Council.

1068
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:32,267
Oh, how he loved that.

1069
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:36,538
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

1070
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,040
he ignored them.

1071
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,778
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

1072
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:46,815
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

1073
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,284
believing in you.

1074
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,698
I'm sorry.

1075
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,969
How could I know
this would happen?

1076
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,338
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1077
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:11,240
No more than we do now.

1078
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,643
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1079
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,412
but I need your help.

1080
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:20,549
Trinity is alive.

1081
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,384
Then there is
another question.

1082
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,253
Why did they keep her alive?

1083
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,587
I can't answer that.

1084
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,024
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

1085
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:30,659
I have to try.

1086
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:34,663
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

1087
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,602
I'm sorry, Neo.

1088
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:44,373
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

1089
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,543
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

1090
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:50,712
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,

1091
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,281
till we have
better understanding

1092
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,782
of what's going on.

1093
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,919
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1094
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:00,789
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1095
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,692
but neither does growing old.

1096
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,894
But you don't
hear me complaining.

1097
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,741
Sorry.

1098
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,877
I've never met
a legend before.

1099
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,315
Neo.

1100
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,384
Sheperd.

1101
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,588
Crazy. You're real.

1102
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:35,657
"Real."

1103
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,760
There's that word again.

1104
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,635
People talk a lot
about the old days.

1105
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,971
About you, the viral Agent.

1106
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,673
The siege of Zion.

1107
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,775
Everything was simpler
back then.

1108
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,345
People wanted to be free.

1109
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,349
It's different now.

1110
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,919
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

1111
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:06,855
Like the Matrix won.

1112
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,093
This is you.

1113
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,366
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1114
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,136
Is it true you could fly?

1115
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:26,975
Cool.

1116
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,807
Morpheus.

1117
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,810
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1118
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:05,747
On the upside,
it's a nice view.

1119
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,916
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

1120
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,718
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the  Mnemosyne

1121
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,920
-with a toothbrush.
-"Supposed to be"?

1122
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,355
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1123
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,690
waiting for you
to make the choice

1124
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,591
to remain meekly incarcerated

1125
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,027
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1126
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:21,697
But that ain't a choice.

1127
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,445
General,
what should we do?

1128
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,451
Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1129
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,019
she had the day you freed her.

1130
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:47,089
This is not
independence of mind.

1131
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,223
It's mutiny.

1132
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,792
Come on, 'Be.

1133
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,895
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

1134
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,698
Just like I know
there's a part of you

1135
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:59,801
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

1136
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:05,107
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

1137
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,478
This scares me.

1138
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,323
That's her.

1139
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,557
On the bridge.

1140
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,092
Got her.

1141
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,003
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

1142
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,839
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

1143
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,574
the way she reads...

1144
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,912
Code-wise,
she's pure bluepill.

1145
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,850
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1146
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,154
What if she's happy
where she is?

1147
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:54,856
How did I read?

1148
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,860
Exactly like her.

1149
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,866
Take us to broadcast depth.

1150
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,646
Thank you for helping me.

1151
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,283
Most of us are here
because of you.

1152
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,053
I also admit our only chance

1153
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,555
to get out
of the general's doghouse

1154
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,290
is for you to find your mojo.

1155
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,561
What if I can't be
what I once was?

1156
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,730
-Then we're all fucked.

1157
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,199
Two minutes.

1158
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:38,667
Two minutes to broadcast.

1159
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,177
I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1160
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,480
Should be safe.

1161
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:04,759
Portal's open.

1162
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,995
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

1163
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,597
Whole zone's
crawling with bots.

1164
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,533
Let's go.

1165
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,897
So, what do you think of him?

1166
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:44,766
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1167
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,369
The beard, the hair... Oh.

1168
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,872
-No, totally works for me.
-You idiot.

1169
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,307
I mean "The One" thing.

1170
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,945
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1171
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,814
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

1172
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,755
Predictable as ever.

1173
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,759
Smith.

1174
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:13,161
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?

1175
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:22,604
This is so insane.

1176
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:23,939
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1177
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:25,674
and they're standing
right there.

1178
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,342
This code is freaky!

1179
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,312
He's like an Agent, but not.

1180
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,084
An appeal to reason.

1181
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,790
How did you find us?

1182
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,793
You never appreciated
our relationship.

1183
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,261
Not like The Analyst.

1184
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:48,263
-The what?
-My doctor.

1185
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:52,033
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1186
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,802
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

1187
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:57,305
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

1188
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:59,374
I still don't know
how he did it.

1189
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,277
You, as a balding nerd.

1190
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,112
Hilarious.

1191
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,548
And me...

1192
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,317
even more perfect.

1193
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:11,386
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1194
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,388
What do you think?

1195
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,457
What do you want, Smith?

1196
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,894
I have such dreams, Tom.

1197
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,696
Big dreams.

1198
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,532
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

1199
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,034
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

1200
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,169
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1201
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:31,873
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.

1202
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:35,143
Inevitable?

1203
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,679
Doesn't have to be.

1204
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:39,914
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1205
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,516
and leave
the good doctor to me.

1206
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,918
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.

1207
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,520
That's the trouble, Tom.

1208
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:48,256
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.

1209
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,226
Trust me.

1210
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,728
You're not ready for him.

1211
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:56,598
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1212
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:05,073
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.

1213
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,783
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.

1214
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:19,220
-Bugs!

1215
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:33,935
Exiles.

1216
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,203
I thought
they were all purged.

1217
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:36,771
You?

1218
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:37,972
Oh!

1219
01:24:38,073 --> 01:24:40,408
It is you!

1220
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:45,313
All these years.
I can't believe it.

1221
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,649
Oh, God.

1222
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,719
You stole my life!

1223
01:24:56,458 --> 01:24:57,992
What the Merv
is trying to say,

1224
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,562
is that their situation
is a little bit like mine.

1225
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,831
To have their lives back,
yours has to end.

1226
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:07,602
Kill him!

1227
01:25:20,815 --> 01:25:23,284
You ruined

1228
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:26,488
every suck-my-silky-ass thing!

1229
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:29,157
We had grace.

1230
01:25:34,195 --> 01:25:35,763
We had style!

1231
01:25:35,830 --> 01:25:37,832
We had conversation!

1232
01:25:37,932 --> 01:25:39,868
Not this...

1233
01:26:04,392 --> 01:26:07,962
Art, films,
books were all better!

1234
01:26:08,029 --> 01:26:11,232
Originality mattered!

1235
01:26:11,332 --> 01:26:13,234
You gave us
Face-Zucker-suck

1236
01:26:13,334 --> 01:26:16,804
and Cock-me-climatey-
Wiki-piss-and-shit!

1237
01:27:02,917 --> 01:27:04,519
I still know kung fu.

1238
01:27:06,387 --> 01:27:07,388
Neo!

1239
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:38,586
Just like old times.

1240
01:28:36,210 --> 01:28:37,278
Neo.

1241
01:28:39,180 --> 01:28:41,849
I've been thinking
about us, Tom.

1242
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:45,219
Look how binary is the form,
the nature of things.

1243
01:28:46,487 --> 01:28:47,789
Ones and zeros.

1244
01:28:48,990 --> 01:28:50,124
Light and dark.

1245
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,295
Choice and its absence.

1246
01:28:57,665 --> 01:28:59,901
Anderson and Smith.

1247
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,740
You've lost something, Tom.

1248
01:29:42,710 --> 01:29:44,545
You're not
what you used to be.

1249
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:46,881
It's true.

1250
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,230
-Nice one.
-Thanks.

1251
01:30:10,071 --> 01:30:11,272
Come on, Neo.

1252
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:38,800
Captain. You okay?

1253
01:30:38,900 --> 01:30:41,836
Yeah. Where's Neo?

1254
01:30:41,936 --> 01:30:43,070
Smith is killing him.

1255
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:44,505
Where?

1256
01:30:52,013 --> 01:30:54,015
I feel bad about this, Tom.

1257
01:30:56,617 --> 01:30:58,753
After all, you are the one
who set me free...

1258
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:01,022
again.

1259
01:31:03,090 --> 01:31:04,158
So, you, more than anyone,

1260
01:31:04,258 --> 01:31:05,860
understands why
I can't go back.

1261
01:31:08,463 --> 01:31:10,264
You should have
listened to me.

1262
01:31:12,467 --> 01:31:14,202
Now you'll never
see her again.

1263
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:28,983
What was that?

1264
01:31:29,050 --> 01:31:30,451
That was Neo.

1265
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,054
Mojo rising.

1266
01:31:41,128 --> 01:31:42,563
You all right?

1267
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:44,165
Yeah.

1268
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,399
It's gonna trigger a response.

1269
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:46,701
I got multiple exits ready.

1270
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:48,236
This is not over yet!

1271
01:31:48,336 --> 01:31:51,038
Our sequel franchise spinoff!

1272
01:31:58,079 --> 01:31:59,514
We should go.

1273
01:31:59,580 --> 01:32:00,748
I can't.

1274
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,750
I have to talk to her.

1275
01:32:02,850 --> 01:32:05,086
Neo, those Exiles
were older than you,

1276
01:32:05,186 --> 01:32:06,254
and we barely handled them.

1277
01:32:09,857 --> 01:32:11,392
You really wanna do this now?

1278
01:32:16,831 --> 01:32:18,032
I mean...

1279
01:32:22,036 --> 01:32:23,604
you look like shit.

1280
01:32:34,882 --> 01:32:37,418
Oh, my God. What?
What happened?

1281
01:32:37,518 --> 01:32:38,619
An accident.

1282
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,055
Kush! Call a doctor.

1283
01:32:41,122 --> 01:32:42,690
It's fine.

1284
01:32:43,591 --> 01:32:45,726
I don't have a lot of time.

1285
01:32:45,793 --> 01:32:47,528
I wasn't sure
I'd see you again.

1286
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:50,197
After we spoke, I realized...

1287
01:32:51,065 --> 01:32:53,100
my life wasn't a life.

1288
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,305
At some point,
I think I gave up

1289
01:32:57,405 --> 01:32:59,640
searching for something real.

1290
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:07,281
Wait.

1291
01:33:08,749 --> 01:33:11,319
Something happened.

1292
01:33:11,419 --> 01:33:13,788
I looked for you
at the coffee shop.

1293
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,925
I began to wonder
if I imagined you.

1294
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,629
And then last night
I had a dream.

1295
01:33:21,729 --> 01:33:24,498
In the dream, you were
surrounded by police,

1296
01:33:24,599 --> 01:33:27,134
then they started chasing us.

1297
01:33:27,234 --> 01:33:30,237
-Us?
-You were on my bike with me.

1298
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:33,774
How did it end?

1299
01:33:35,176 --> 01:33:36,344
Not good.

1300
01:33:38,913 --> 01:33:42,316
I've had dreams
that weren't just dreams.

1301
01:33:42,416 --> 01:33:44,652
You mean a dream
that came true?

1302
01:33:52,326 --> 01:33:54,962
Finally, we can talk
like adults.

1303
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,767
I hate lying. I do.
It exhausts me.

1304
01:34:01,535 --> 01:34:03,638
Tiff and I have been
waiting for you...

1305
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:04,972
like, forever.

1306
01:34:12,046 --> 01:34:13,347
Deja vu, right?

1307
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:17,318
Oh, no use.
You can't beat time.

1308
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:21,122
This rewind is happening
faster than you can blink.

1309
01:34:25,993 --> 01:34:27,995
You gave me the idea.

1310
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:34,135
Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

1311
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:38,305
"Bullet time."

1312
01:34:40,141 --> 01:34:42,076
I know. Kind of ironic,

1313
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:46,080
using the power
that defined you
to control you.

1314
01:34:46,180 --> 01:34:48,816
I kept such a close eye on you

1315
01:34:48,883 --> 01:34:51,419
and still you found a way out.

1316
01:34:51,519 --> 01:34:53,888
Clever monkey,
using that Modal.

1317
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:56,023
Call me an optimist,

1318
01:34:56,090 --> 01:34:58,259
but this could
all be for the best.

1319
01:34:58,359 --> 01:35:01,195
The skin's not looking
too bad this time.

1320
01:35:01,262 --> 01:35:03,898
I know some of this will be
difficult for you to hear,

1321
01:35:03,998 --> 01:35:05,433
after everything
you went through.

1322
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:06,901
All that pain and suffering,

1323
01:35:07,001 --> 01:35:09,837
only to learn the world
doesn't end when you do.

1324
01:35:11,372 --> 01:35:12,440
Surprise.

1325
01:35:18,446 --> 01:35:19,880
I was there when you died.

1326
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:23,517
I said to myself,

1327
01:35:23,584 --> 01:35:26,787
"Here is the anomaly
of anomalies."

1328
01:35:26,887 --> 01:35:29,690
What an extraordinary
opportunity.

1329
01:35:31,358 --> 01:35:32,793
First, I had to convince
the Suits

1330
01:35:32,893 --> 01:35:34,295
to let me rebuild
the two of you.

1331
01:35:34,395 --> 01:35:35,963
Why her? Getting there.

1332
01:35:36,063 --> 01:35:37,865
And don't worry,
she can't hear me.

1333
01:35:37,932 --> 01:35:41,068
Resurrecting you both
was crazy expensive.

1334
01:35:41,135 --> 01:35:42,470
Like renovating a house.

1335
01:35:42,570 --> 01:35:44,805
Took twice as long,
cost twice as much.

1336
01:35:48,909 --> 01:35:51,378
I thought you'd be happy
to be alive again.

1337
01:35:52,413 --> 01:35:53,647
So wrong.

1338
01:35:55,449 --> 01:35:59,086
Did you know hope and despair
are nearly identical in code?

1339
01:36:01,088 --> 01:36:03,057
We worked for years,

1340
01:36:03,124 --> 01:36:04,759
trying to activate
your source code.

1341
01:36:04,825 --> 01:36:08,262
I was about to give up,
when I realized...

1342
01:36:11,332 --> 01:36:12,399
Trinity.

1343
01:36:12,466 --> 01:36:14,635
...it was never just you.

1344
01:36:14,735 --> 01:36:17,805
Alone, neither of you
is of any particular value.

1345
01:36:19,507 --> 01:36:20,674
Like acids and bases,

1346
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:23,144
you're dangerous
when mixed together.

1347
01:36:23,244 --> 01:36:26,180
Every sim
where you two bonded...

1348
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:28,349
Let's just say
bad things happened.

1349
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:31,852
Neo!

1350
01:36:36,123 --> 01:36:39,493
However, as long as I managed
to keep you close,

1351
01:36:39,593 --> 01:36:41,262
but not too close,

1352
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:44,532
I discovered
something incredible.

1353
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:48,135
Now, my predecessor
loved precision.

1354
01:36:48,202 --> 01:36:51,872
His Matrix was all fussy facts
and equations.

1355
01:36:51,972 --> 01:36:53,707
He hated the human mind.

1356
01:36:53,808 --> 01:36:55,209
So he never bothered
to realize

1357
01:36:55,309 --> 01:36:56,477
that you don't give a shit
about facts.

1358
01:36:56,544 --> 01:36:57,978
It's all about fiction.

1359
01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:02,716
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1360
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,820
And you people
believe the craziest shit.

1361
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,621
Why?

1362
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,291
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1363
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:12,326
Feelings.

1364
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,962
Allow me.

1365
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,998
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

1366
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:19,400
They're everywhere.

1367
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,069
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

1368
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:24,638
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1369
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:29,410
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

1370
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:44,992
Ooh! Nicely done.

1371
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:49,697
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

1372
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:52,733
Why your own brain
tortures you?

1373
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,337
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1374
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:57,571
It works just like this.

1375
01:37:57,671 --> 01:38:00,274
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

1376
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,277
If only you could move faster.

1377
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,913
Here's the thing
about feelings.

1378
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:08,282
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

1379
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,118
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1380
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:14,688
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1381
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:17,224
the more energy you produce.

1382
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,526
It's nuts.

1383
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:21,195
I've been setting
productivity records

1384
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:22,563
every year since I took over.

1385
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:25,466
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

1386
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:26,934
People stay in their pods,

1387
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:30,104
happier than pigs in shit.

1388
01:38:30,204 --> 01:38:31,405
The key to it all?

1389
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:32,806
You.

1390
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,074
And her.

1391
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,377
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1392
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,879
while dreading
losing what you do.

1393
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:40,614
For 99.9% of your race,

1394
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:43,384
that is the definition
of reality.

1395
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:46,320
Desire and fear, baby.

1396
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:49,390
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1397
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,735
She's the only home
you have, Thomas.

1398
01:39:01,802 --> 01:39:05,105
Come home before
something terrible happens.

1399
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:16,817
-Bugs!
-I hear him.

1400
01:39:23,190 --> 01:39:24,358
Trinity!

1401
01:39:24,458 --> 01:39:26,160
-You shouldn't call me that.
-I'm sorry.

1402
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:28,929
I have to go.

1403
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:30,164
But I'll be back.

1404
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:33,600
Neo! Time to go.

1405
01:39:36,103 --> 01:39:37,805
-Sentinels?
-Worse.

1406
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:40,341
General ordered me

1407
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:41,442
to look after the ship.

1408
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:43,377
So you shadowed us?

1409
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,045
Check your long-range scans.

1410
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:47,147
Squids are combing this area.

1411
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:48,682
He's right.

1412
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:49,950
You can stay here and die,

1413
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:52,386
or come back
and face a court-martial.

1414
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:54,488
And you call that a choice?

1415
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:03,831
Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

1416
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:07,301
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

1417
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:08,569
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1418
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,571
Do shut your mouth.

1419
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,973
Do address me as General.

1420
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:17,311
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

1421
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:19,380
which she exercised
with her own

1422
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:22,983
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1423
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,319
Shortsighted?

1424
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:30,924
You care more
about growing fruit
than freeing minds.

1425
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,527
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1426
01:40:33,594 --> 01:40:35,929
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

1427
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,231
You gave up on people.

1428
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,035
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

1429
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:42,202
and it's you!

1430
01:40:44,605 --> 01:40:46,540
Sheperd, get her
out of my sight!

1431
01:40:46,607 --> 01:40:47,741
General...

1432
01:40:49,676 --> 01:40:50,744
Disarm!

1433
01:40:50,844 --> 01:40:52,446
Kujaku's a friend.

1434
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:00,621
Hello, friend.

1435
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:04,224
Okay.

1436
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:06,760
Him?

1437
01:41:13,700 --> 01:41:15,369
General.

1438
01:41:15,436 --> 01:41:16,737
Thank you for seeing me.

1439
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:18,605
I figured if there was anyone

1440
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:20,974
who could make sense
of this mess,

1441
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,876
it would be you.

1442
01:41:22,943 --> 01:41:24,078
Hello, Neo.

1443
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:25,979
I know you.

1444
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,082
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1445
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:32,653
Why?

1446
01:41:32,753 --> 01:41:34,488
We met a long time ago.

1447
01:41:36,223 --> 01:41:37,291
Good morning.

1448
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:41,095
Sati.

1449
01:41:41,161 --> 01:41:43,664
My father knew
we'd meet again,

1450
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:46,733
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1451
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,602
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1452
01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:50,938
was the greatest regret
of his life.

1453
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:52,906
I don't understand.

1454
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,943
My father
was the chief engineer

1455
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:57,277
at the Anomaleum.

1456
01:41:57,344 --> 01:41:58,745
The what?

1457
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:01,915
My father designed
the resurrection pods

1458
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:03,917
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

1459
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,187
I'm sorry.

1460
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:08,789
You knew what happened to him?

1461
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:12,092
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

1462
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:14,361
and you didn't tell me?

1463
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:17,364
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1464
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:19,099
But Io needed you.

1465
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:20,501
This city needed to be built

1466
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:22,636
for your people
as well as mine.

1467
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,539
If I would have
told you everything,

1468
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,808
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

1469
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:29,476
My friends

1470
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,313
let me make my own choices.

1471
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,315
If it was a mistake,

1472
01:42:35,382 --> 01:42:37,484
you have my deepest apologies.

1473
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:40,888
Why are you here now?

1474
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,490
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.

1475
01:42:43,557 --> 01:42:44,825
The Anomaleum
draws its current

1476
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:46,226
from Trinity alone now.

1477
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,495
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

1478
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:50,564
the Matrix back
to the previous version.

1479
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,466
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

1480
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:53,834
He's convinced the authorities

1481
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:55,869
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

1482
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,906
And why would he say that?

1483
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:02,075
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1484
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:07,214
Faced with returning
to your pod

1485
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:10,083
or enduring
Trinity's death again.

1486
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:11,485
What would you choose, Neo?

1487
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:13,854
I'll go back.

1488
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,758
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

1489
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:20,594
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1490
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,362
After you escaped,

1491
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:25,265
he should have
accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

1492
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:28,235
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1493
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:30,237
that now exists before us.

1494
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:33,840
A few hours ago,

1495
01:43:33,907 --> 01:43:37,211
no one would have been able
to convince me

1496
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:41,582
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1497
01:43:41,682 --> 01:43:43,617
as crazy as this one.

1498
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:49,056
What are you doing?

1499
01:43:49,122 --> 01:43:50,691
-Volunteering.
-Oh, no.

1500
01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:55,295
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1501
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:56,964
Now you don't
have to order me, General,

1502
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,732
'cause I'm volunteering.

1503
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:03,637
I need two more.

1504
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:10,978
Are you out of your minds?

1505
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:12,946
You don't even know
what it is.

1506
01:44:13,046 --> 01:44:15,949
General, we know you.

1507
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:17,251
If you say this is important,

1508
01:44:17,317 --> 01:44:19,386
none of us is
choosing to stay home.

1509
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:25,826
Thank you.

1510
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:32,933
Knuckle up, and good luck.

1511
01:45:02,963 --> 01:45:04,464
Trinity is held
in the Anomaleum,

1512
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:06,300
which is in this
transmission tower.

1513
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:08,635
The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed

1514
01:45:08,702 --> 01:45:10,937
and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.

1515
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:13,040
So, stealth will be paramount.

1516
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,875
As long as we raise no alarms,

1517
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:17,044
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

1518
01:45:17,144 --> 01:45:18,378
You mean
crossing the Fetus Fields,

1519
01:45:18,478 --> 01:45:20,213
sneaking across
an entire power plant,

1520
01:45:20,314 --> 01:45:21,715
climbing
a two-kilometer tower

1521
01:45:21,815 --> 01:45:23,650
guarded by thousands
of Sentinels?

1522
01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:24,885
That's the easy part?

1523
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,653
Exactly so.

1524
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,056
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1525
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:30,824
who does this every day

1526
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:32,326
to take one of us along.

1527
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,684
Fifty meters
below the Anomaleum

1528
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:59,252
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.

1529
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:02,756
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1530
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:06,026
This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,

1531
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:09,196
which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.

1532
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,064
I get it.

1533
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:14,034
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.

1534
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:16,403
What could go wrong?

1535
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:04,651
Once inside,

1536
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:06,586
Morpheus will use
the System Operator

1537
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:08,989
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.

1538
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:14,661
In order to unplug
Trinity's body,

1539
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,963
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,

1540
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:18,665
I'm gonna need
a second human brain

1541
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:19,966
to implement the bypass.

1542
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:21,668
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,

1543
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:24,938
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

1544
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:26,072
is yours.

1545
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:28,508
Figures.

1546
01:47:46,026 --> 01:47:47,160
Thanks, Cybebe.

1547
01:47:55,368 --> 01:47:57,370
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?

1548
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:58,872
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring

1549
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:00,273
her consciousness
onto the ship,

1550
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,008
it's not strictly necessary.

1551
01:48:02,108 --> 01:48:06,012
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

1552
01:48:06,112 --> 01:48:09,382
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

1553
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,851
in all probability, kill her.

1554
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:13,487
But even if it is
what she wants,

1555
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:17,224
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

1556
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:18,825
He will.

1557
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:21,361
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

1558
01:48:21,461 --> 01:48:22,395
Why?

1559
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:24,130
Because we'll already be gone.

1560
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:27,734
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

1561
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,236
there has to be a reason why.

1562
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:32,672
When my father realized

1563
01:48:32,739 --> 01:48:35,008
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

1564
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:38,545
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1565
01:48:38,645 --> 01:48:41,147
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

1566
01:48:41,214 --> 01:48:43,083
and had my parents purged.

1567
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:48,722
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1568
01:48:51,758 --> 01:48:55,762
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1569
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:58,999
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1570
01:49:07,073 --> 01:49:08,608
We're coming up on broadcast.

1571
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:15,215
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1572
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:21,087
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

1573
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:26,726
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

1574
01:49:26,793 --> 01:49:29,429
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1575
01:49:29,529 --> 01:49:31,064
What if we're too late?

1576
01:49:32,866 --> 01:49:34,568
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

1577
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:42,742
I never believed
I was The One.

1578
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,045
But she did.

1579
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:47,714
She believed in me.

1580
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:52,586
It's my turn
to believe in her.

1581
01:50:17,577 --> 01:50:19,479
This is
where it gets tricky.

1582
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:33,026
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1583
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,828
Not yet.

1584
01:50:56,549 --> 01:50:57,884
Here we go.

1585
01:51:15,535 --> 01:51:17,470
Welcome home.

1586
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:19,906
All I want is to talk to her.

1587
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:21,641
Do you mean Tiff?

1588
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:24,477
Come back,
and you can talk to her
as often as you like.

1589
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:25,912
I mean, handsome Chad

1590
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:27,480
may have something
to say about it.

1591
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:30,850
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

1592
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:33,219
you win.

1593
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:34,421
Really?

1594
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,257
But if she wants me,

1595
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,192
then you'll let us go free.

1596
01:51:39,259 --> 01:51:42,028
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1597
01:51:42,095 --> 01:51:44,898
Right now,
I'm on a ship full of people
who will unplug me

1598
01:51:44,998 --> 01:51:48,001
before they'll let you
take me back.

1599
01:51:48,068 --> 01:51:50,103
If you want this Matrix,

1600
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:51,738
this is your only chance.

1601
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:54,774
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1602
01:51:54,874 --> 01:51:58,211
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

1603
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:25,472
Okay.

1604
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,073
I like tests.

1605
01:52:27,941 --> 01:52:29,743
We'll let Tiff decide.

1606
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:48,261
That's it.

1607
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:50,997
Bypass is ready.

1608
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:52,799
Now what?

1609
01:52:52,899 --> 01:52:54,134
We wait.

1610
01:52:54,234 --> 01:52:56,169
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1611
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:57,837
and leave her here?

1612
01:52:57,937 --> 01:53:00,607
We must abide by her decision.

1613
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:02,275
And if she says no,

1614
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:04,577
what happens to Neo?

1615
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:05,845
At this time,

1616
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:08,782
the most important choice
of Neo's life

1617
01:53:08,848 --> 01:53:10,350
is not his to make.

1618
01:53:41,381 --> 01:53:43,183
I saw this in my dream.

1619
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:48,121
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1620
01:53:48,788 --> 01:53:50,356
The Oracle.

1621
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:52,125
From your game?

1622
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:56,229
It's not a game.

1623
01:53:58,364 --> 01:53:59,566
Oh, God.

1624
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:10,476
After you left, I went home

1625
01:54:10,543 --> 01:54:12,245
and I played it.

1626
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:17,083
I kept thinking,

1627
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,520
why does this story
feel like a memory?

1628
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:29,429
There's a part of me

1629
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:35,235
that feels like
I have been waiting
my whole life for you.

1630
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:40,440
And that part is like,

1631
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:44,244
"What the hell
took you so long?"

1632
01:54:44,344 --> 01:54:46,379
I don't have an easy answer.

1633
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:50,717
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1634
01:54:52,185 --> 01:54:54,053
Afraid of what might happen.

1635
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:58,558
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1636
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:03,796
I wish I was
who you think I am.

1637
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:06,766
But look at me.

1638
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:10,236
I can't be her.

1639
01:55:10,303 --> 01:55:12,438
-Mom!
-Mom! Come on.

1640
01:55:12,538 --> 01:55:13,773
-Mom!
-It's Callie.

1641
01:55:13,873 --> 01:55:14,874
Is this real?

1642
01:55:14,941 --> 01:55:16,109
You have to come with us.

1643
01:55:16,209 --> 01:55:17,577
Come on,
we gotta go.

1644
01:55:17,644 --> 01:55:19,145
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

1645
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:20,580
but I'm glad we found you.

1646
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:21,948
-She got hit by a car!
-I know, it's crazy.

1647
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:23,149
She was chasing after you.

1648
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,584
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.

1649
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:26,052
Doctor said
she's gonna be fine.

1650
01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:27,921
You have to come
with us to the hospital.

1651
01:55:27,987 --> 01:55:29,088
It's too late.

1652
01:55:29,155 --> 01:55:30,390
I understand.

1653
01:55:30,456 --> 01:55:32,292
-Tiff, come on, let's go.
-Come on.

1654
01:55:38,798 --> 01:55:39,899
What's happening?

1655
01:55:41,968 --> 01:55:43,102
Neo was wrong.

1656
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:17,537
Tiffany.

1657
01:56:21,140 --> 01:56:23,676
Tiffany, you have
to come with us.

1658
01:56:25,311 --> 01:56:26,679
Tiffany!

1659
01:56:28,982 --> 01:56:32,685
I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1660
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:34,320
I hate that name.

1661
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:37,357
My name is Trinity

1662
01:56:37,457 --> 01:56:39,826
and you better
take your hands off of me.

1663
01:56:51,004 --> 01:56:52,005
Neo!

1664
01:56:52,505 --> 01:56:53,506
Trinity!

1665
01:56:54,674 --> 01:56:55,708
Oh, shit.

1666
01:56:57,010 --> 01:56:58,344
Get her out. Get her out!

1667
01:57:06,986 --> 01:57:10,256
Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1668
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:13,026
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

1669
01:57:13,092 --> 01:57:16,095
Women used to be
so easy to control.

1670
01:57:16,195 --> 01:57:20,733
You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1671
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,605
Cannot happen.

1672
01:57:28,775 --> 01:57:31,611
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

1673
01:57:32,745 --> 01:57:34,547
She dies

1674
01:57:34,614 --> 01:57:36,015
and it's all your fault.

1675
01:57:37,550 --> 01:57:40,119
Lies, lies and more lies.

1676
01:57:40,887 --> 01:57:42,088
Smith?

1677
01:57:42,188 --> 01:57:43,289
What has the world come to

1678
01:57:43,389 --> 01:57:44,557
when you can't even
trust a program?

1679
01:57:44,624 --> 01:57:47,960
-How...

1680
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:50,797
Tom and I have more in common
than you know.

1681
01:57:50,897 --> 01:57:53,933
Once he got out,
let's just say,

1682
01:57:54,767 --> 01:57:56,569
I was free to be me.

1683
01:58:04,243 --> 01:58:06,979
-Yeah!
-Trinity?

1684
01:58:55,361 --> 01:58:56,529
You ready?

1685
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:57,930
Yeah.

1686
01:59:40,006 --> 01:59:41,474
Oh, no.

1687
01:59:42,842 --> 01:59:45,211
Destroy her. Destroy her!

1688
02:00:02,195 --> 02:00:03,196
No.

1689
02:00:09,035 --> 02:00:10,536
Stop them.

1690
02:00:36,195 --> 02:00:37,697
You think this is over?

1691
02:00:37,763 --> 02:00:39,765
Lockdown. Initiate swarm.

1692
02:00:48,741 --> 02:00:51,077
Here, our unexpected
alliance ends.

1693
02:00:52,745 --> 02:00:55,381
You know the difference
between us, Tom?

1694
02:00:55,448 --> 02:00:57,316
Anyone could have been you.

1695
02:00:57,416 --> 02:00:59,452
Whereas I've always
been anyone.

1696
02:01:04,824 --> 02:01:06,325
What just happened?

1697
02:01:06,425 --> 02:01:07,593
What?

1698
02:01:09,595 --> 02:01:12,164
-Oh, no! Move! Move!

1699
02:01:12,265 --> 02:01:13,299
Get the hell out of there!

1700
02:01:17,169 --> 02:01:19,138
-How bad?
-Like, all the bad.

1701
02:01:20,439 --> 02:01:21,907
Yeah, this is bad.

1702
02:01:23,276 --> 02:01:24,910
I don't suppose
you can still fly?

1703
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:36,989
Yeah, that's not happening.

1704
02:02:02,715 --> 02:02:03,983
Neo! Get on.

1705
02:02:12,658 --> 02:02:14,460
Calliope! Take the wounded!

1706
02:02:14,527 --> 02:02:16,562
Everyone else,
we stay with them!

1707
02:02:33,646 --> 02:02:36,182
-How is she?
-Life signs are good.

1708
02:02:40,019 --> 02:02:41,487
Her signal's strong, Captain.

1709
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:52,398
Well done, Captain.

1710
02:02:54,767 --> 02:02:56,669
All we need is a miracle.

1711
02:03:24,730 --> 02:03:25,765
I hate bots.

1712
02:03:32,071 --> 02:03:33,906
-Get us out of here!
-I'm trying!

1713
02:03:33,973 --> 02:03:35,975
The lockdown is tracking.
Swarm is everywhere.

1714
02:03:36,075 --> 02:03:37,243
Never seen anything like this.

1715
02:04:23,122 --> 02:04:25,291
Seq, what is that?

1716
02:04:30,296 --> 02:04:31,430
What's wrong?

1717
02:04:33,132 --> 02:04:34,633
What are you...

1718
02:04:42,174 --> 02:04:44,210
He's turning bots into bombs.

1719
02:05:16,675 --> 02:05:17,877
Shit!

1720
02:05:17,977 --> 02:05:18,978
Lexy?

1721
02:05:33,359 --> 02:05:34,560
Sheperd's in trouble.

1722
02:05:37,663 --> 02:05:39,431
Jack me in.

1723
02:05:39,532 --> 02:05:41,567
I can get you in.
I don't know
if I can get you out.

1724
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,241
-No!

1725
02:06:02,588 --> 02:06:03,722
What are they doing?

1726
02:06:07,760 --> 02:06:09,428
Herding them into a kill zone.

1727
02:06:42,494 --> 02:06:43,829
Captain, you gotta hurry.

1728
02:06:43,929 --> 02:06:46,165
-Hang on, Lex.

1729
02:06:50,402 --> 02:06:52,237
-Lexy!

1730
02:07:34,480 --> 02:07:35,648
There they are!

1731
02:08:02,074 --> 02:08:03,242
Morpheus!

1732
02:08:07,146 --> 02:08:08,847
Lex.

1733
02:08:08,914 --> 02:08:10,816
-Bugsy.
-Hell yeah!

1734
02:08:11,750 --> 02:08:13,385
Seq, where's Neo?

1735
02:08:13,485 --> 02:08:15,087
It's bad. They're pinned.

1736
02:08:15,187 --> 02:08:16,255
Heading to a roof.

1737
02:09:25,557 --> 02:09:26,792
Nodal fibrillation
is critical.

1738
02:09:26,892 --> 02:09:28,293
She'll die
if we don't extract.

1739
02:10:09,301 --> 02:10:11,937
It's so beautiful.

1740
02:10:27,219 --> 02:10:28,954
I remember this.

1741
02:10:31,023 --> 02:10:33,225
I remember us.

1742
02:10:51,343 --> 02:10:53,345
My dream ended here.

1743
02:11:04,223 --> 02:11:05,824
We can't go back.

1744
02:11:07,926 --> 02:11:09,027
We won't.

1745
02:11:28,280 --> 02:11:29,681
Can they make the jump?

1746
02:12:00,746 --> 02:12:02,381
I'm not doing this.

1747
02:12:02,447 --> 02:12:03,815
Are you doing this?

1748
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:29,007
Bye.

1749
02:13:50,055 --> 02:13:51,656
How dramatic.

1750
02:13:52,491 --> 02:13:53,759
"Tiffany"?

1751
02:13:53,859 --> 02:13:56,828
It was a private joke.

1752
02:13:56,895 --> 02:13:58,430
An amusement, that's all.

1753
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:00,866
An amusement? Hmm.

1754
02:14:02,601 --> 02:14:04,770
-Whoa.

1755
02:14:04,870 --> 02:14:06,271
Kind of like that?

1756
02:14:10,542 --> 02:14:13,278
Okay. Ow.

1757
02:14:13,378 --> 02:14:14,846
If you hated the name so much,

1758
02:14:14,913 --> 02:14:17,082
why did you heel like
a good little bitch so long?

1759
02:14:20,218 --> 02:14:22,454
Yeah. Definitely asked
for that.

1760
02:14:27,759 --> 02:14:29,728
Can't you control her?

1761
02:14:35,567 --> 02:14:37,269
That was for using children.

1762
02:14:42,140 --> 02:14:43,642
We have a few questions.

1763
02:14:43,742 --> 02:14:45,577
You tried to activate
the fail-safe.

1764
02:14:45,644 --> 02:14:46,978
The Suits tried.

1765
02:14:47,079 --> 02:14:49,381
Obviously, without control
of your source code,

1766
02:14:49,448 --> 02:14:50,816
I knew that was impossible.

1767
02:14:50,916 --> 02:14:53,118
So, why haven't
the Suits purged you?

1768
02:14:53,985 --> 02:14:56,655
Because I know the system.

1769
02:14:56,755 --> 02:14:59,157
I know human beings.

1770
02:14:59,257 --> 02:15:01,426
And I know you.

1771
02:15:03,829 --> 02:15:06,398
Right now, you're feeling good
about what you've done.

1772
02:15:06,465 --> 02:15:08,900
You should.
It was a victory. Bravo.

1773
02:15:09,734 --> 02:15:11,069
Now what?

1774
02:15:11,136 --> 02:15:13,772
You've come here to negotiate
some kind of deal?

1775
02:15:13,839 --> 02:15:15,440
You think you hold
all the cards,

1776
02:15:15,507 --> 02:15:17,943
because you can do
whatever you want
in this world.

1777
02:15:18,009 --> 02:15:20,345
I say, go for it.

1778
02:15:20,445 --> 02:15:23,014
Remake it.
Knock yourselves out.

1779
02:15:23,115 --> 02:15:25,150
Paint the sky with rainbows.

1780
02:15:25,250 --> 02:15:26,418
But here's the thing.

1781
02:15:26,485 --> 02:15:29,521
The sheeple aren't
going anywhere.

1782
02:15:29,621 --> 02:15:30,822
They like my world.

1783
02:15:30,922 --> 02:15:33,825
They don't want
this sentimentality.

1784
02:15:33,925 --> 02:15:35,827
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.

1785
02:15:35,927 --> 02:15:38,330
They want to be controlled.

1786
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:40,365
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

1787
02:15:40,465 --> 02:15:43,201
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

1788
02:15:43,301 --> 02:15:46,838
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

1789
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:53,812
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

1790
02:15:53,879 --> 02:15:56,148
We were on our way
to remake your world.

1791
02:15:56,214 --> 02:15:57,782
Change a few things.

1792
02:15:57,849 --> 02:15:59,050
I kind of like

1793
02:15:59,151 --> 02:16:00,485
the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.

1794
02:16:00,552 --> 02:16:02,487
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

1795
02:16:02,554 --> 02:16:04,055
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

1796
02:16:04,156 --> 02:16:06,558
-He makes it easy.
-That, he does.

1797
02:16:06,658 --> 02:16:08,860
Something he should
think about.

1798
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:11,062
Before we got started,

1799
02:16:11,163 --> 02:16:13,999
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

1800
02:16:14,065 --> 02:16:17,169
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

1801
02:16:17,235 --> 02:16:18,637
And what is that?

1802
02:16:19,504 --> 02:16:21,306
Another chance.

1803
02:27:24,535 --> 02:27:27,338
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

1804
02:27:27,405 --> 02:27:29,340
Games are dead.

1805
02:27:29,407 --> 02:27:31,175
Narrative? Dead.

1806
02:27:31,242 --> 02:27:33,211
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

1807
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:34,512
and viral conditioning.

1808
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:36,080
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

1809
02:27:38,349 --> 02:27:40,184
Cat videos.

1810
02:27:40,251 --> 02:27:44,021
What we need is
a series of videos

1811
02:27:44,088 --> 02:27:46,424
that we call "The Catrix."
