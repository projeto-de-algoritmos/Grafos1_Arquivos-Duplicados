[Seq]  I've got
serious interference.

10
00:01:03,463 --> 00:01:04,798
[woman]  Weird.
It's some kind of Modal.

11
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,699
[Seq]  Looks like old code.

12
00:01:06,766 --> 00:01:08,134
[woman]  It feels
really familiar.

00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,969

I'll signal for backup.

check it out.

we've been fishing...

this is a direct violation

is a loop? Or a treadmill?

I searched everywhere.
He doesn't exist.

133
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:16,856
He stopped being Thomas
a long time ago,

134

but maybe you know him
by his real name.

00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,863

00:09:24,931 --> 00:09:26,532
Oh, okay.

138
00:09:27,199 --> 00:09:28,467
Uh...

139
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,203
I can't believe this,
after all these years.

140
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:34,941
You see, most people
think that Neo is dead.

141
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,710
But I know he's not.

142
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,413
Because I've seen him.

143
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:44,450
Where?

144
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:47,086
It's not something
I can explain easily, but...

145
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,727
But the moment
he looked at me,

146
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,429
I felt something...

147
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,467
unlock my mind.

148
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,104
Okay.

149
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:09,342
Something like that
happened to me.

150
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,948
I saw this pattern...

151
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:18,651
and it was everywhere.

152
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,655
We can't see it,
but we're all trapped inside

153
00:10:22,755 --> 00:10:25,291
these strange,
repeating loops.

154
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:28,628
Somehow I saw it
in the mirror.

155
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,464
Just a flicker,
but it was like you said.

156
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:39,338
And suddenly I understood.

157
00:10:39,438 --> 00:10:41,874
This is not the real world.

158
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,680

I felt real purpose.

159
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:50,316
I knew who I was

160
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:52,318
and what I had to do.

161
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,387
Who are you?

162
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,456
What do you have to do?

163
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:01,694
I am...

164
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,863
Morpheus.

165
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:07,299
And I have to find Neo.

00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:17,376
Okay. Okay.

169
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,544
Oh, my God!

170
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:19,912
I have to get you out of here.

171
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:22,415
I need to figure out
who built this Modal.

172
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,083
Okay, come with me.

173
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,318
You have to be ready to leave.
You have to be really ready.

174
00:11:26,385 --> 00:11:27,687
And if you're not,

175
00:11:27,753 --> 00:11:28,754
if you think that
this is where you belong...

176
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:33,693
You call this a choice?

177
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,261
Oh, honestly, when somebody
offered me these things,

178
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,862
I went off on binary
conceptions of the world

179
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,531
and said there was no way
I was swallowing

180
00:11:38,597 --> 00:11:40,499
some symbolic reduction
of my life.

181
00:11:40,566 --> 00:11:41,901
And the woman
with the pills laughed

182
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,169
'cause I was
missing the point.

183
00:11:43,235 --> 00:11:44,770
What point?

184
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,773
The choice is an illusion.

185
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:50,076
You already know
what you have to do.

186
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:57,917
Truth.

187
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:05,624
Okay.

188
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:06,926
There's an old building

189
00:12:07,026 --> 00:12:08,594
with a skylight
and lots of stairs.

190
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:09,895
The Lafayette.

191
00:12:09,962 --> 00:12:11,530
One of the four back doors
leads there.

192
00:12:12,364 --> 00:12:13,466
[Morpheus] Oh.

193
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,067
-Don't fight it.
-Whoa, what's happening?

194
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:16,235
Keep breathing.

195
00:12:16,302 --> 00:12:17,703
Extraction works
pretty much the same

196
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,705
for humans and programs.

197
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:23,542
Ouch.

198
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:24,643
Ah.

199
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,379
Okay.

200
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,317
-Hey.
-Hey.

201
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,219
I've never worn
different glasses before.

202
00:12:33,285 --> 00:12:36,055
Yeah, looks good.
Which door?

203
00:12:36,122 --> 00:12:37,923
-It's gotta be...
-Okay.

204
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:44,663
Agent White.

205
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,965
Agent Smith?

206
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:47,299
[laughs]

207
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,602
[Bugs grunts]

208
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,139
-[Bugs] Go!
-[grunts]

209
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:58,978
[men grunting]

210
00:13:00,346 --> 00:13:02,014
Seq! Can you hear me?

211
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,349
Bugs! I thought I lost you.

212
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:04,683
Can you get us
to the window pane?

213
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:06,752
Bugs! Bugs! He's an agent!

214
00:13:09,588 --> 00:13:11,323
[Morpheus exclaims, grunts]

215
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,165
That window! Go hard!

216
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,842
[both screaming]

217
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,316
[screaming fades]

218
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,861
[keyboard clacking]

219
00:14:00,406 --> 00:14:02,341
[fast-paced music
playing on speakers]

220
00:14:05,377 --> 00:14:07,847
-[computer buzzing]
-What the...

221
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,088
What the hell?

222
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,424
[suspenseful music playing]

223
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:34,273
Something wrong?

224
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:37,109
Uh... Just a little crash.

225
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,578
Morning, Bobbi. Morning, dude.

226
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,449
What a beautiful day
to be alive. Am I right?

227
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:45,551
-Problemo?
-He lost something.

228
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,187
Is this old  Matrix  code?

229
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,757
A little Modal experiment.

230
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:54,793
-For  Binary?
-[cell phone chimes]

231
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,529
-I need a coffee.
-Coffee. Yes, stat!

232
00:14:57,596 --> 00:14:58,731
I'm buying.

233
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,469
[man] I'm not trying to blow
smoke up your ass,

234
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:07,973
but the first time I played
the trilogy, I was shook.

235
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,643
The paradox
between free will and destiny.

236
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,911
Are we all just algorithms

237
00:15:11,977 --> 00:15:13,212
doing what we're
supposed to do

238
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:14,980
or can we escape
our programming?

239
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,984
Genius, inside the context
of the game, BT dubs.

240
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,153
Hey, did I tell you
it took over my life?

241
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:23,989
Yeah. I failed
the seventh grade. [chuckles]

242
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,258
Your game almost ruined me.

243
00:15:26,325 --> 00:15:28,827
-So you've said.
-Yet here we are.

244
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,764
-[cups clink]
-You tell me, Mr. Anderson,

245
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,898
is it free will

246
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,768
or destiny?

247
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,341
Oh, yeah.

248
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,343
There she is.

249
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,945
Total f-ing MILF.

250
00:15:46,812 --> 00:15:48,914
Daggers. Look, I'm sorry.

251
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,283
I'm a geek.
I was raised by machines.

252
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,618
Maybe you should go.

253
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:55,754
No, please.
I... I promise, best self.

254
00:15:55,821 --> 00:15:57,089
Best self.

255
00:16:00,993 --> 00:16:02,261
Sure.

256
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,530
You ever talk to her?

257
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:08,100
Tell you what.

258
00:16:08,167 --> 00:16:12,538
For all you've done for me,
let me do this for you.

259
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,374
Jude, no. Stop.

260
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,176
-Excuse me. Excuse me.
-Thanks.

261
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:18,677
Hi. Um...

262
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,346
I know this is all
a bit extemporaneous.

263
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,047
I'm Jude Gallagher.

264
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,717
I work for a game company
called Deus Machina.

265
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,051
Hi, Jude, I'm Tiffany.

266
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,054
Tiffany. Wow.
Didn't see that coming.

267
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:31,056
-Mom loved Audrey Hepburn.
-Jude.

268
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,060
Oh, and this is my very
good friend, Thomas Anderson.

269
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,062
He is a bona fide
famous person

270
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,530
and considered by most to be

271
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,632
the greatest game designer
of our generation.

272
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,900
I'm sorry about this.

273
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,202
-Jude...
-[softly] Just talk to her.

274
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:45,804
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

275
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,873
Hi.

276
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,181
Have we met?

277
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,752
Uh, we both come here.

278
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,253
-Can I have your morning bun?
-[boy] Hey!

279
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,755
Are you trying
to ball my mom or what?

280
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,156
-Brandon!
-[chuckles]

281
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,091
[boy 2] Can I have one bite?

282
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,194
Babe! What's going on?
We're gonna be late.

283
00:17:09,261 --> 00:17:11,196
This is my husband, Chad.

284
00:17:11,263 --> 00:17:13,065
-Nice to meet you.
-Hey.

285
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,769
Babe, we gotta get
Callie to practice.

286
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,937
Right. Sorry. [chuckles]

287
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,672
Come on, kids. Let's move out.

288
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,178
[soft music playing]

289
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,031
What?

290
00:17:46,098 --> 00:17:48,033
[keyboard clacking]

291
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:50,436
[ominous music playing]

292
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:55,808
Sorry. Uh, it's the boss.

293
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,817
"Billions of people
just living out their lives...

294
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,886
oblivious."

295
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:12,224
I always loved that line.

296
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,759
You wrote that one, yeah?

297
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:18,630
Every time I stand here,

298
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,967
I mean, O-M-G.

299
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,103
It's so perfect,
it's gotta be fake.

300
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,572
-Right?
-[chuckles softly]

301
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,675
Yeah.

302
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,677
Sure.

303
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:33,612
Have a seat.

304
00:18:35,314 --> 00:18:36,515
[man sighs]

305
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:37,816
Smoke?

306
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,152
I thought you quit.

307
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,422
I quit calling it a habit.

308
00:18:43,489 --> 00:18:45,424
Now it's just
a guilty pleasure.

309
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:51,163
Oh. Maybe I can make this
easy for you.

310
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,298
I know  Binary  is over budget.

311
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,667
This is not about  Binary,  Tom.
It's bigger than that.

312
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,102
This is about our future,

313
00:18:57,169 --> 00:19:00,139
which is a sticky subject,
given our past.

314
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,440
What do you mean?

315
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,143
How's the therapy?

316
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,511
Good.

317
00:19:06,211 --> 00:19:07,679
Any...

318
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,982
episodes?

319
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:12,851
No.

320
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,287
That's terrific.

321
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,492
Look, Tom, I know we've
always had our differences.

322
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,394
What did you say
about our first meeting?

323
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:25,731
We had all the chemistry
of an FBI interrogation.

324
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,865
[muffled yell]

325
00:19:27,366 --> 00:19:28,367
[scoffs]

326
00:19:28,467 --> 00:19:29,868
But look at this place.

327
00:19:30,969 --> 00:19:32,304
We did this.

328
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:34,873
Together.

329
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:37,709
Yeah.

330
00:19:37,809 --> 00:19:39,745
Now what?

331
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,415
Things have changed.
The market's tough.

332
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,817
I'm sure you can understand
why our beloved

333
00:19:45,884 --> 00:19:47,252
parent company, Warner Bros.,

334
00:19:47,352 --> 00:19:49,755
has decided to make
a sequel to the trilogy.

335
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,256
What?

336
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:53,258
They informed me they're gonna
do it with or without us.

337
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,194
I thought
they couldn't do that.

338
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,328
[exhales]

339
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:57,763
Oh, they can.

340
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,198
And they made it clear

341
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,433
they'll kill our contract
if we don't cooperate.

342
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:03,235
Really?

343
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:07,206
I know you said the story
was over for you,

344
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:09,441
but that's the thing
about stories.

345
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:13,178
They never really end,
do they?

346
00:20:13,245 --> 00:20:15,781
We're still telling the same
stories we've always told,

347
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:20,185
just with different names,
different faces

348
00:20:21,787 --> 00:20:24,890
and I have to say
I'm kind of excited.

349
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,894
After all these years,

350
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,964
to be going back
to where it all started.

351
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,399
Back to  The Matrix.

352
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:37,236
I've spoken to Marketing...

-[sinister music playing]
-[distorted voice]

354
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,743
[in normal voice] Tom?

355
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,378
Yeah.

356
00:20:46,445 --> 00:20:47,479
Are you all right?

357
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,981
[exhales nervously]

358
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:50,949
Yeah.

359
00:20:55,887 --> 00:20:58,090
[analyst] What were you feeling
at that point?

360
00:21:01,159 --> 00:21:02,961
What was I feeling?

361
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:11,003
I felt either I'm having
a mental breakdown again

362
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,340
or I'm living inside
a computer-generated reality

363
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,975
that has imprisoned me...

364
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,777
again.

365
00:21:19,511 --> 00:21:20,746
[laughs]

366
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:23,849
[chuckles softly]

367
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:30,956
Not much of a choice.

368
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:32,257
No.

369
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,925
Maybe it's not
as binary as that.

370
00:21:33,992 --> 00:21:37,296
Maybe there are other ways
to understand what happened.

371
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:38,964
Yeah.

372
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:41,199
Thomas, you are
a suicide survivor

373
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,169
gifted with
a powerful imagination.

374
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:46,004
Those facts have combined

375
00:21:46,104 --> 00:21:48,607
to create dangerous fictions
in your life.

376
00:21:48,674 --> 00:21:50,208
Yesterday,
you walked into a meeting

377
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,443
with your business partner

378
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,978
and he ambushed you,

379
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:55,480
demanding you make a game
you said you would never make.

380
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:58,884
This attack effectively
took away your voice.

381
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,720
His violence triggered you
and your mind fought back.

382
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,689
You did to him
what he was doing to you.

383
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,558
We've talked about the value

384
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:10,195
of adaptive anger
in healing trauma.

385
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:13,665
Far from suggesting a repeat
of your initial breakdown,

386
00:22:13,732 --> 00:22:14,966
I believe this episode

387
00:22:15,033 --> 00:22:16,835
demonstrates healthy
self-protection.

388
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,572
And more importantly,
I remember how hard

389
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,709
it was for you
to share something like this.

390
00:22:23,809 --> 00:22:26,511
Which tells me
just how far we've come.

391
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,381
[chuckles softly]

392
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:33,885
Do you need a refill
on your prescription?

393
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:35,687
[sighs]

394
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:36,922
Yeah.

395
00:22:41,893 --> 00:22:43,195
[pills rattle]

396
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,168
[mysterious music playing]

397
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,276
[grunts softly]

398
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,747
First of all, I know
I speak for everyone

399
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,116
when I say that
I'm so, so excited

400
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,284
to be working on a game
that was such a...

401
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,453
well, game changer.

402
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,122
Now, the packet
in front of you

403
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,024
has our focus group research.

404
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:14,559
Inside, you'll find
the breakdown

405
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:17,462
including keyword association
with the brand.

406
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,632
The top two being
"originality" and "fresh,"

407
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:22,768
which I think are great things
to keep in mind

408
00:23:22,868 --> 00:23:25,070
as you begin
working on  Matrix 4.

409
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,206
And who knows how many more?

410
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,109
[alarm buzzing, stops]

411
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,083
[singing indistinctly]

412
00:23:43,722 --> 00:23:47,125
What made  Matrix  different?
It effed with your head.

413
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:48,493
On point.

414
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,595
People want us
up in their grey space,

415
00:23:50,662 --> 00:23:53,732
switching their synaptic
"WTF" light on.

[man laughing]

418
00:24:02,841 --> 00:24:06,178
What made  Matrix  different?
It effed with your head.

419
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,113
People want us
up in their grey space,

420
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,514
switching their synaptic

421
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,250
"What the hell
is going on here?" light on.

422
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,625
[panting]

423
00:24:20,692 --> 00:24:22,260
[shower running]

424
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:26,531
I didn't love the first one,
like some of you.

425
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:29,034
And, frankly,
I've got zero tolerance

426
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,536
for anything that requires
a syllabus and a highlighter.

427
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,505
I like my games big,
loud and dumb.

428
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,540
We need guns! Lots of guns.

429
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,210
Matrix  means mayhem.

430
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,946
[grunting]

431
00:24:42,881 --> 00:24:45,050
Mindless action
is not on-brand.

432
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,551
[man] She's right.

433
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:49,688
Matrix  is mind-porn.
Philosophy in shiny...

434
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,456
-tight PVC.
-Yeah.

435
00:24:51,523 --> 00:24:53,391
Ideas are the new "sexy."

["White Rabbit"

437
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:09,241
Obviously
The Matrix  is about...

438
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:11,576
-...trans-politics.
-Crypto-fascism.

439
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,577
It's a metaphor...

440
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,346
...of capitalist exploitation.

441
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:31,196
This cannot be another reboot,
retread, regurgitated...

442
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,365
Why not? Reboots sell.

443
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:38,503
We are so far down the wrong
rabbit hole, here, people.

444
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:42,407
You say  Matrix  to anyone...
You say  Matrix...

445
00:25:42,507 --> 00:25:45,443
[echoing] Matrix...
Matrix... Matrix...

446
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,379
...this is what they see.

Allow me to sum up our goal
in a single word.

450
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:58,590
Bullet time! Bullet time!

451
00:25:59,257 --> 00:26:00,292
That's two words.

452
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:07,465
We need
a new "bullet time." [echoing]

453
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:09,968
[laughs maniacally]

454
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:13,972
We need to revolutionize
gaming again.

455
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:17,876
Revolutionize gaming
again! [echoing]

[barista]  Afternoon, Tiff.

The ushe?

459
00:26:46,838 --> 00:26:49,007
You know what, Skroce?
I'm going wild.

460
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,610
I'll have a cortado today.

461
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:54,245
Fly that freak flag.

462
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:56,081
Mind if I get that?

463
00:26:56,147 --> 00:26:57,182
Oh, hi.

464
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:00,185
Hi.

465
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:02,787
[Tiffany] I remember
wanting a family,

466
00:27:02,854 --> 00:27:04,155
but was that because

467
00:27:04,255 --> 00:27:06,925
that's what women
are supposed to want?

468
00:27:06,992 --> 00:27:08,693
How do you know
if you want something yourself

469
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,930
or if your upbringing
programmed you to want it?

470
00:27:11,997 --> 00:27:12,998
Mmm.

471
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:16,001
I pay my analyst
a lot of money

472
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,670
to answer
such questions for me.

473
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,971
Smart.

474
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,272
I should get more therapy

475
00:27:21,339 --> 00:27:23,775
but honestly,
I'm too goddamn tired.

476
00:27:23,842 --> 00:27:25,610
Kids are exhausting, you know?

477
00:27:27,178 --> 00:27:29,447
No. Never had kids.

478
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,283
Oh, right, I knew that.

479
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,819
-Sorry. I googled you.
-[chuckles]

480
00:27:36,788 --> 00:27:39,357
So, what's it like being
a world-famous game designer?

481
00:27:39,457 --> 00:27:41,993
-Must be amazing.
-Uh...

482
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:43,561
A lot of hours.

483
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:45,697
Sometimes it is amazing.

484
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,298
Most times...

485
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,801
I don't know.

486
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,370
But you made  The Matrix.
Even I've heard of that.

487
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:56,241
Yeah. We kept
some kids entertained.

488
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,476
-So, worth it?
-[chuckles]

489
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:07,385
Can I ask something
about your game?

490
00:28:07,485 --> 00:28:08,720
Sure.

491
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,056
Did you base your
main character on yourself?

492
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,196
There is a lot of me in him.

493
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:20,598
[indistinct shouting]

494
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,868
Maybe a little too much.

495
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,605
Can I ask you something else?

496
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,907
Please.

497
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,911
There's a woman in your game.

498
00:28:34,112 --> 00:28:35,113
Trinity.

499
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:39,718
Which is a weird
coincidence also, right?

500
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:42,387
God, yeah.

501
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:45,023
I like her.

502
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,526
-I like Trinity.
-Ah.

503
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:49,861
And I dig her Ducati.

504
00:28:49,928 --> 00:28:52,931
Another coincidence.
I love motorcycles.

505
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,134
[engine revs]

506
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:58,937
My friend Kush and I
actually build them.

507
00:28:59,037 --> 00:29:00,138
Really?

508
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,608
You have your analyst,
I have my bikes.

509
00:29:03,708 --> 00:29:08,313
So, I was looking at images
from your game. At Trinity.

510
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,616
Well, I showed Chad a scene,

511
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,752
and I was like,
"So, what do you think?"

512
00:29:14,819 --> 00:29:17,322
He didn't get it until I said,

513
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,424
"Don't you think
she looks like me?"

514
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:22,961
You know what he did?

515
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,563
He laughed.

516
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,138
And I laughed too,
like it was a joke.

517
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:34,773
How could it not be, right?

518
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:38,610
Made me so angry.

519
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,447
I hated myself for laughing.

520
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:47,185
I wanted to kick him so hard.

521
00:29:48,486 --> 00:29:49,788
Not too hard.

522
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:53,091
Maybe just hard enough
to break his jaw off.

523
00:29:53,158 --> 00:29:54,325
[chuckles]

524
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,129
And right now,
you're probably regretting

525
00:29:58,196 --> 00:29:59,697
sitting down with me.

526
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:05,770
This is the best thing
I've done in a long time.

527
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:08,106

Hi, this is Tiff.

531
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,715
Oh, God, no.

[gasps]

533
00:30:19,784 --> 00:30:21,786
I'll be right there.

stuck a Lego up his nose.

535

Oh.

536
00:30:28,293 --> 00:30:29,327
I gotta go.

537
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,132
I hope I see you again.

[alarm blaring]

[announcer on speaker]
There has been a report

540
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:54,752
of an emergency.

541
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,754
Proceed calmly
to the nearest exit

542
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,890
and leave the building
immediately.

543
00:30:58,990 --> 00:31:00,358
What's going on?

544
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:02,260
We probably just got swatted
by some 14-year-old.

545
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,928
Yeah, someone pissed
about the latest update.

546
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,430
Or they're just a dick.

547
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,266
Please move to the exits.
Building's being evacuated.

548
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,701
[cell phone buzzes]

549
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,184
[suspenseful music playing]

550
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,222
[security guard] Sir, this way.

551
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,229
Jude?

552
00:31:39,731 --> 00:31:40,798
Jude!

553
00:31:47,272 --> 00:31:49,240
At last.

554
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,310
[chuckles] Ah.

555
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,878
I wasn't too sure
about the callback,

556
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:55,947
but, you know,
it was hard to resist.

557
00:31:56,047 --> 00:31:57,148
What?

558
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,650
Morpheus Uno.
Reveal at the window.

559
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:01,219
Lightning,
thunder and theater.

560
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:03,154
At last.

561
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:05,657
All these years later,
here's me,

562
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,992
strolling out
of a toilet stall.

563
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,227
Tragedy or farce?

564
00:32:09,294 --> 00:32:10,929
I know you.

565
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,997
Not every day
you meet your maker.

566
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,265
This can't be happening.

567
00:32:14,332 --> 00:32:16,000
Oh, most definitely is.

568
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,569
You can't be
a character I coded.

569
00:32:18,636 --> 00:32:20,672
100% natural.

570
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,512
[gasps softly]

571
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:29,347
How?

572
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:31,616
All the explanation you need.

573
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,454
Oh.

574
00:32:36,521 --> 00:32:37,689
No.

575
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,524
No, no, no.

576
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,426
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What do you mean, "no"?

577
00:32:41,492 --> 00:32:44,128
You wanted this, you did this.
This was your idea.

578
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:48,533
[hesitating]
It was a test. An experiment.

579
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:51,035
An experiment?

580
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,539
You put me
in a tiny-ass Modal,

581
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,007
left me to bang my head till

582
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,343
I nearly lost my shit
searching for you

583
00:32:58,443 --> 00:32:59,944
as an experiment.

584
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,013
-The exit's breaking down.
-He hasn't taken the pill.

585
00:33:02,113 --> 00:33:03,448
What? There's no time.

586
00:33:03,514 --> 00:33:05,550
I know, I know.
He's having a moment.

587
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:08,119
Does he know how hard it was
to hack that mirror?

588
00:33:08,186 --> 00:33:10,355
[tense music playing]

589
00:33:10,455 --> 00:33:12,056
Still open.

590
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,560
This... This can't be real.

591
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,495
[SWAT officer] Target acquired.
We got him.

592
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,003
[grunting]

593
00:33:25,069 --> 00:33:26,404
This isn't happening.

594
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:28,973
It's in my mind.
It's in my mind.

595
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,241
[SWAT officer 2] Hey, you!
Stop! Hold it!

596
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,479
[all screaming]

597
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:39,917
[groaning]

598
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,892
This can't be happening.

599

-[gunshots]
-[gasps]

600
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,764
[SWAT officer 3]
Freeze! Don't move!

601
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:56,434
[gun firing]

602
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:02,874
Neo!

603
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,082
[tense music playing]

604
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,386
[gun firing]

605
00:34:17,755 --> 00:34:19,190
Oh, my God!

606
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,027
[distorted gunfire]

607
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:31,402
[men groaning]

608
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:34,539
[grunting]

609
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,813
[tense music continues]

610
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,992
Neo!

611
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,797
[tense music builds]

612
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:02,100
[shouts] Mr. Anderson!

613
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,168
No!

614
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,303
It can't be.

615
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,947
I've missed you.

616
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,688
[cat meows]

617
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:28,326
[bell tinkling]

618
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:32,864
It's in my mind.

619
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:35,366
It's in my mind.

620
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:43,474
[cup clinking]

621
00:35:43,541 --> 00:35:45,042
[analyst]
Can you hear me, Thomas?

622
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:49,113
Follow my voice.

623
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,884
Feel the tips of your fingers.
What are they touching?

624
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,352
[bell tinkling]

625
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:56,320
The bell.

626
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,224
Do you hear the bell?

627
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,697
Do you remember what happened?
How you got here?

628
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,634
You must have walked.

629
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,902
I heard Deja Vu outside,

630
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:12,236
opened my door,
and there you were.

631
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,508
[Thomas Anderson exhales]

632
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:20,411
You feel like
you can talk about it?

633
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,746
When we started
working together,

634
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:23,581
you had lost your capacity

635
00:36:23,681 --> 00:36:26,217
to discern reality
from fiction.

636
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,487
You came to me after
trying to jump off a building.

637
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:31,856
You said you wanted
to fly away.

638
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:36,827
[indistinct chatter]

639
00:36:41,098 --> 00:36:42,500
[people shouting]

640
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,939
We have made
a lot of progress since then,

641
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,374
but you seem particularly
triggered right now.

642
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:51,909
Can you tell me
how it started?

643
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,613
He texted me.

644
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,115
Who?

645
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,684
Morpheus.

646
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:00,851
Ah.

647
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,921
So, he's back.

648
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:06,190
It wasn't actually him.

649
00:37:07,358 --> 00:37:10,628
It was a program
I coded for a Modal.

650
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,897
And this "Modal," Morpheus,

651
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:14,966
came to help you escape

652
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,703
from a virtual reality
called  The Matrix.

653
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,781
Am I crazy?

654
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:33,317
We don't use that word
in here.

655
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:36,320
What word should I use?

656
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:39,757
What word explains
what is happening to me?

657
00:37:39,824 --> 00:37:41,492
Can I see the texts?

658
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,894
[exhales]

659
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:45,496
They were erased.

660
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,105
If we got in my car
and drove to your office,

661
00:37:54,171 --> 00:37:56,140
what do you think
we'd find there?

662
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,275
Nothing.

663
00:37:59,977 --> 00:38:02,079
Because there was no attack.

664
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:04,849
No one was killed.

665
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,918
No one texted.

666
00:38:07,985 --> 00:38:10,021
My mind made it all up.

667
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:14,125
Is that what
I'm supposed to say?

668
00:38:14,191 --> 00:38:15,693
Is that what you believe?

669
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,362
It felt real.

670
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:20,197
Of course.

671
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,200
It was your great ambition
to make a game

672
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,670
that was indistinguishable
from reality.

673
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:27,204
To achieve this goal,

674
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,774
you converted elements
of your life into narrative.

675
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,109
Your sublimated anger
toward your business partner

676
00:38:32,176 --> 00:38:34,378
cast him as your nemesis.

677
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,113
A married woman named Tiffany

678
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,517
became the "Trinity"
of a doomed romance.

679
00:38:39,617 --> 00:38:43,788
Even your dislike of my cat
made it into your  Matrix.

680
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:45,656
There's nothing wrong
with that.

681
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,191
It's what artists do.

682
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:50,661
But it becomes a problem
when fantasies

683
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,064
endanger us or other people.

684
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:57,702
We don't want anyone
to get hurt,

685
00:38:57,802 --> 00:38:59,170
do we, Thomas?

686
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:09,380
Hi, Thomas.
Everyone calls me "Tiff."

687
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,882
-Who are you?
-My name is Trinity.

688
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:13,584
[Oracle]  No one can tell you
you're in love.

689
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,187
You just know it,
through and through.

690
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:18,756
Balls to bones.

691
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:20,658
[Trinity whispers]
You feel this?

692
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,061
I'm never letting go.

693
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:26,097

[both grunting]

695
00:39:31,736 --> 00:39:33,771
[Morpheus]  You have
to let it all go, Neo.

696
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,240
Free your mind.

700
00:39:55,025 --> 00:39:56,460
Huh.

701
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,562
Looks easy enough.

702
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,235
[exhales]

703
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,038
"Free my mind." Shit.

00:40:09,807 --> 00:40:11,575
[suspenseful music playing]

705
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:15,246
Okay.

706
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:16,747
Free my mind.

707
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,821
[grunts]

708
00:40:32,963 --> 00:40:34,498
I fly...

709
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,334
or I fall.

710
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:38,903
[suspenseful music builds]

713
00:40:45,142 --> 00:40:46,410
Who the hell are you?

714
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,346
You won't remember me,

715
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:52,683
but a long time ago,
you changed my life

716
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,152
when you leapt off
another roof.

717
00:40:55,252 --> 00:40:58,155
Back then, I was just like
any other coppertop,

718
00:40:58,255 --> 00:40:59,957
pretending my life...

719
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:04,161
until I looked up
and I saw you.

720
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:06,764
It was a different you,
but I saw

721
00:41:07,531 --> 00:41:09,300
the real you,

722
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:11,168
just a second before...

723
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,704
you leapt.

724
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,972
[people shouting]

725
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,277
And you never fell.

726
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:27,718
Are you the one
that hacked my Modal?

727
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:29,320
Yeah.

728
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:30,721
[cell phone buzzing]

729
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,356
That'll be Jude.

730
00:41:32,456 --> 00:41:33,791
He's not your friend.

731
00:41:33,858 --> 00:41:35,326
He's a handle,
a program used to control you.

732
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,460
He's on his way here,

733
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,362
and he's bringing
Agents with him.

734
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,065
Jude.

735
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,566
Bro, I've been calling you
all night.

736
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,368
We have a major problemo.

737
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,505
Are you alone?

738
00:41:50,241 --> 00:41:53,043
That's kind
of a sexy question, dude.

739
00:41:53,143 --> 00:41:55,412
[Bugs] They don't look like
typical Agents.

740
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,914
They use bots now,
skinned as normal people,

741
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,148
which means they're everywhere

742
00:41:58,215 --> 00:42:00,484
and you never know
who to trust.

743
00:42:00,551 --> 00:42:02,319
Why should I trust you?

744
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,491
Because if they open
that door, we lose our hack.

745
00:42:07,558 --> 00:42:09,260
I will be caught and killed

746
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,561
and you will be put right back

747
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:11,896

they designed for you,

748
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:13,097

the last time

749
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,365

your way out.

00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,102
I know why you left
your Modal open.

751
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,671
You needed someone else
to free Morpheus.

752
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,773
And it's because of him
that we were able
to get to you.

753
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:24,742
I know these things
the same way

754
00:42:24,842 --> 00:42:27,578
that I knew one day
I would find you.

755
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,281
And that when I did,
you would be ready for this.

If you want the truth, Neo,

757
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,523
you're going
to have to follow me.

00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,059

does that mean

Obviously not.

00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,863
Why the Machines
kept you alive

to such lengths to hide you

What we didn't understand

804
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:22,219
was that they could
alter your DSI.

805
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:24,054

Why did it take 20 years

It took a lot longer
than that.

There's so much we don't know.

818
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,631
Like why you've barely aged,

819
00:46:07,731 --> 00:46:09,933
or how many times
they've altered your DSI.

820

[Morpheus] But based on
what we do know,

821
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,770
it appears no one found you

822
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,671
because you didn't
want to be found.

823
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,508
-That's not true.
-[Morpheus] Maybe it isn't.

that you disappeared,

All I'm saying is
this is the moment

risked their lives

1096
01:04:50,253 --> 01:04:51,420
to help get you out.

1097
01:04:52,889 --> 01:04:53,890
Thank you.

1098
01:04:55,424 --> 01:04:56,459
But why?

1099
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:59,095
[Morpheus]
Not all seek to control.

1100
01:04:59,195 --> 01:05:01,197
Just as not all
wish to be free.

1101
01:05:02,965 --> 01:05:04,233
What is that?

1102
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,602
An exomorphic-particle codex.
It's pretty new.

1103
01:05:06,702 --> 01:05:08,804
It gives programs
access to this world.

1104
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:10,106
Within limits.

1105
01:05:10,206 --> 01:05:13,209
Limits are the domain
of the limited.

1106
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:14,810
Morpheus.

1107
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:15,945
Thank you.

1108
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:17,446
It was my honor.

1109
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,483
[chuckles] Wow.

1110
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,751
-[crew chuckles]
-How does it work?

1111
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:23,319
Paramagnetic oscillation.

1112
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,587
If you want,

1113
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:25,922
I can download
the codex manual for you.

1114
01:05:25,988 --> 01:05:28,424
-Sure.
-Downloading used to be fun.

1115
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:30,893
Now it's all manuals
and diagnostics.

1116
01:05:30,960 --> 01:05:32,662
Can I ask them something?

1117
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,834
When you unplugged me,
there was another pod?

1118
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,102
[warbling softly]

1119
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:43,072
Yes. We've analyzed the data.

1120
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,608
It could be Trinity.

1121
01:05:46,442 --> 01:05:48,010
It's her.

1122
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:51,180
I figured we were going
to have this conversation.

1123
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,183
Look, you were not
a typical flush-and-grab.

1124
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:55,952
You were in this weird tower
that Cybebe

1125
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,120
had never accessed,
and she's now exiled.

1126
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,589
We burned
our one shot for you.

1127
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,692
Even if it were Trinity
and she wanted to be free,

1128
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,827
we have no idea how to do it.

1129
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,928
Yet.

1130
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:11,200
Nobody believed
we'd ever find him,

1131
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:12,335
but we did.

1132
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,672
Okay.

1133
01:06:16,772 --> 01:06:19,875
We don't know
how to get her out... yet.

1134
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,613
Captain, we're approaching
security clearance.

1135
01:06:25,881 --> 01:06:27,049
We're here.

1136
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:28,184
Zion?

1137
01:06:36,292 --> 01:06:37,727
Have a seat.

1138
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,563
This is Hanno.
Best pilot in our fleet.

1139
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,630
Quite a few synthients

1140
01:06:41,697 --> 01:06:43,165
deserve that title before me.

1141
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:44,400
[Control on radio]
Mnemosyne,  you are cleared

1142
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,868
for landing. Welcome home.

1143
01:06:45,968 --> 01:06:47,636
[Hanno] Thank you, Control.

1144
01:06:47,703 --> 01:06:49,305
Um, we're about to crash.

1145
01:06:50,306 --> 01:06:52,208
[dramatic music playing]

1146
01:06:55,011 --> 01:06:56,145
[chuckles]

1147
01:06:56,212 --> 01:06:57,480
General realized we were

1148
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:59,582
never going to beat
the Sentinels, so...

1149
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,817
we just got better
at hiding from them.

1150
01:07:06,389 --> 01:07:07,990
Welcome to Io.

1151
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,027
Io.

1152
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,895
[sweeping music playing]

1153
01:07:17,433 --> 01:07:20,202
Wow. That looks real.

1154
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,271
Bio-sky.

1155
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:28,210
Works kind of like
grow lights.

1156
01:07:28,277 --> 01:07:29,945
It's way more complex
than that.

1157
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:32,515
It pulls water from the crust,
hydronating the air.

1158
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,918
It balances the ECO
and our SRI cycles.

1159
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,354
Plus... [sighs]

1160
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:40,956
it is pretty to look at.

1161
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:42,858
As opposed to that.

1162
01:07:44,126 --> 01:07:46,729
I guess the general sent us
a welcome party.

1163
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:06,415
God damn.

1164
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:08,717
It is you.

1165
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,753
Niobe?

1166
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:16,158
A few more wrinkles
and a few less teeth,

1167
01:08:16,258 --> 01:08:19,929
but wise enough to know
I don't know anything.

1168
01:08:19,995 --> 01:08:22,665
I sure as shit
never saw this coming.

1169
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:24,667
Neither did I.

1170
01:08:24,767 --> 01:08:26,102
I told you he was alive.

1171
01:08:26,168 --> 01:08:28,137
Captain, you and your crew
have been grounded.

1172
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:29,839
General,
if you'd just let me explain.

1173
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:32,575
The protocols are put in place
for everyone's protection.

1174
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,510
I'm sorry.
I saw an opportunity

1175
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,078
and I was afraid
we'd lose him.

1176
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,814
But, General, people have been
waiting for so long.

1177
01:08:40,483 --> 01:08:41,750
We found The One.

1178
01:08:43,586 --> 01:08:45,287
I don't believe in The One.

1179
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,657
I never did.

1180
01:08:49,325 --> 01:08:50,426
No?

1181
01:08:51,494 --> 01:08:53,028
Me neither.

1182
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:55,498
But there was a time

1183
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:58,267
when you trusted me
with your ship,

1184
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:00,136
against the Council's orders.

1185
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:02,304
The world was different then.

1186
01:09:04,140 --> 01:09:05,774
We were different.

1187
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:09,211
Report to the docks.

1188
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:11,013
Scrub down the  Mnemosyne.

1189
01:09:11,113 --> 01:09:13,382
Transfer your access codes.

1190
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:14,884
You are done, Captain.

1191
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:16,018
[gasps softly]

1192
01:09:24,560 --> 01:09:26,395
We need to talk.

1193
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,303
[Niobe] When word first came

1194
01:09:34,370 --> 01:09:36,639
that it actually
might be you...

1195
01:09:40,376 --> 01:09:44,180
I didn't know how I would feel
in this moment.

1196
01:09:52,054 --> 01:09:54,023
It is nice to see you.

1197
01:09:54,089 --> 01:09:56,825
-It's good to see you too.
-[glasses clink]

1198
01:10:02,698 --> 01:10:05,434
A long way
from Dozer's paint stripper.

1199
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,504
[chuckles] Yes.

1200
01:10:08,571 --> 01:10:10,339
A lot has changed.

1201
01:10:11,874 --> 01:10:13,776
Except maybe you.

1202
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,113
You remember this?

1203
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,957
It's so easy to forget
how much noise

1204
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:29,959
the Matrix pumps
into your head

1205
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:31,860
until you unplug.

1206
01:10:31,927 --> 01:10:33,229
[Neo sighs]

1207
01:10:33,295 --> 01:10:34,697
Yeah.

1208
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,700
Something else
makes the same kind of noise.

1209
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,969
Takes over every damn thing,

1210
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:41,770
just like the Matrix.

1211
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:44,440
War.

1212
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,777
I stood at the barricade
of the Temple.

1213
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:52,881
Staring
at the army of Sentinels,

1214
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:56,619
waiting for them
to kill every one of us.

1215
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:01,156
But then, they left.

1216
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:04,827
They said you saved us.

1217
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,095
I didn't believe it.

1218
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:09,498
Every night I would dream
of attack sirens.

1219
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:11,433
But then,

1220
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,238
I would wake up to this...

1221
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:21,677
silence.

1222
01:11:25,147 --> 01:11:26,682
I'm ashamed of it now.

1223
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:30,786
My pessimism of how long
it took me to believe

1224
01:11:30,853 --> 01:11:34,123
a world without war
was possible.

1225
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,526
You gave me that.

1226
01:11:37,626 --> 01:11:40,496
You gave that gift to us all.

1227
01:11:40,596 --> 01:11:44,266
And it is the gift
that continues to bear fruit.

1228
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,704
Come help me get up.

1229
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:50,539
Let's take a walk.

1230
01:11:50,639 --> 01:11:53,842
[mysterious music playing]

1231
01:12:03,519 --> 01:12:05,054
[elevator door opens]

1232
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:16,665
Oh! Beautiful.

1233
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:20,703
This is Freya, head of botany.

1234
01:12:20,803 --> 01:12:24,073
And this is Quillion,
our lead digitologist.

1235
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:28,177
I presume our guest
needs no introduction.

1236
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,913
Nothing travels
faster than light,

1237
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:32,247
except gossip.

1238
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:33,382
[Freya chuckles]

1239
01:12:34,650 --> 01:12:36,051
Welcome to the Garden, Neo.

1240
01:12:38,087 --> 01:12:39,254
A strawberry?

1241
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,056
Using digital code
from the Matrix,

1242
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:43,559
we retro-convert it
into DNA sequences.

1243
01:12:43,659 --> 01:12:45,060
And they grow here?

1244
01:12:45,160 --> 01:12:46,762
It's not easy
augmenting the genome

1245
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,398
to photosynthesize
Bio-sky, but...

1246
01:12:49,498 --> 01:12:51,233
-We're getting there.
-[chuckles]

1247
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:53,702
Go ahead. Try it.

1248
01:12:59,842 --> 01:13:01,110
[Niobe chuckles]

1249
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:03,412
We're quite excited
about the blueberries.

1250
01:13:03,512 --> 01:13:05,414
You remember that shit
we used to eat?

1251
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,883
That slop
that tasted like rust.

1252
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:13,088
Zion could have never
made something like this.

1253
01:13:13,188 --> 01:13:14,790
Why?

1254
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:17,459
Because we needed synthients

1255
01:13:17,559 --> 01:13:19,528
and DI like him.

1256
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:22,965
Zion was stuck in the past.
Stuck in war.

1257
01:13:23,065 --> 01:13:25,434
Stuck in a Matrix of its own.

1258
01:13:25,534 --> 01:13:29,405
They believed
that it had to be us or them.

1259
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:32,474
This city was built by us

1260
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,243
and them.

1261
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:41,450
What happened to Zion?

1262
01:13:41,550 --> 01:13:44,953
I've been waiting
for you to ask that question.

1263
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,392
All of the troubles
started in the Machine Cities.

1264
01:13:50,459 --> 01:13:54,163
Power plants were unable
to produce enough energy.

1265
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:58,000
Nothing can breed violence
like scarcity.

1266
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,336
For the first time,

1267
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:04,640
we saw machines at war
with one other.

1268
01:14:07,643 --> 01:14:11,647
We got word from the Oracle
of a new power rising.

1269
01:14:13,615 --> 01:14:16,285
That was the last
we heard from her.

1270
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:21,323
Morpheus.

1271
01:14:21,423 --> 01:14:25,794
[Niobe] After the siege,
he was elected unanimously.

1272
01:14:25,861 --> 01:14:28,764
High Chair of the Council.

1273
01:14:28,831 --> 01:14:32,267
Oh, how he loved that. [scoffs]

1274
01:14:32,334 --> 01:14:36,538
But as rumors
of this new power spread,

1275
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:38,040
he ignored them.

1276
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:42,778
He was certain what you had
done could not be undone.

1277
01:14:42,845 --> 01:14:46,815
All of these people never
stopped believing in miracles,

1278
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,284
believing in you.

1279
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:02,698
I'm sorry.

1280
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:06,969
How could I know
this would happen?

1281
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,338
We didn't understand
all of it back then.

1282
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:11,240
No more than we do now.

1283
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:14,643
I didn't come here
to cause you problems, Niobe,

1284
01:15:15,677 --> 01:15:17,412
but I need your help.

1285
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:20,549
Trinity is alive.

1286
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:22,384
Then there is
another question.

1287
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,253
Why did they keep her alive?

1288
01:15:24,353 --> 01:15:25,587
I can't answer that.

1289
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:29,024
But if there's a chance
I can free her,

1290
01:15:29,091 --> 01:15:30,659
I have to try.

1291
01:15:30,726 --> 01:15:34,663
Even if it means endangering
everyone in this city?

1292
01:15:38,901 --> 01:15:40,602
I'm sorry, Neo.

1293
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:44,373
I won't let what happened
to Zion happen to Io.

1294
01:15:46,174 --> 01:15:47,543
I hope you'll forgive
an old woman

1295
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:50,712
for asking you to go
with Sheperd, here,

1296
01:15:50,779 --> 01:15:52,281
till we have
better understanding

1297
01:15:52,381 --> 01:15:53,782
of what's going on.

1298
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:56,919
You're going to imprison me
after I just got free?

1299
01:15:57,019 --> 01:16:00,789
I know it doesn't seem fair,

1300
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:03,692
but neither does growing old.

1301
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,894
But you don't
hear me complaining.

1302
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:10,198
[elevator whirring]

1303
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,741
Sorry.

1304
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,877
I've never met
a legend before.

1305
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:26,315
Neo.

1306
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,384
Sheperd. [breathes shakily]

1307
01:16:29,451 --> 01:16:30,652
[chuckles in disbelief]

1308
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:32,588
Crazy. You're real.

1309
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:35,657
"Real."

1310
01:16:36,758 --> 01:16:38,760
There's that word again.

1311
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,635
[Sheperd] People talk a lot
about the old days.

1312
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,971
About you, the viral Agent.

1313
01:16:49,071 --> 01:16:51,673
The siege of Zion.

1314
01:16:51,773 --> 01:16:53,775
Everything was simpler
back then.

1315
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:56,345
People wanted to be free.

1316
01:16:58,447 --> 01:17:00,349
It's different now.

1317
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:03,919
Sometimes it feels like
people gave up.

1318
01:17:05,153 --> 01:17:06,855
Like the Matrix won.

1319
01:17:06,955 --> 01:17:08,256
[unlocks door]

1320
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:11,093
This is you.

1321
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:17,366
And I gotta ask you one thing.

1322
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,136
Is it true you could fly?

1323
01:17:25,974 --> 01:17:26,975
Cool.

1324
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,215
[locks door]

1325
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:48,030
[trickling]

1326
01:17:56,371 --> 01:17:57,406
[Morpheus grunts]

1327
01:17:57,506 --> 01:17:58,807
Morpheus.

1328
01:17:58,874 --> 01:18:01,810
Oh. General stuck you
in the Rapunzel tower.

1329
01:18:03,145 --> 01:18:04,179
[Morpheus exhales]

1330
01:18:04,246 --> 01:18:05,747
On the upside,
it's a nice view.

1331
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:07,916
What happened to Bugs
and the others?

1332
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,718
They're supposed to be
sterilizing the  Mnemosyne

1333
01:18:09,818 --> 01:18:11,920
-with a toothbrush.
-"Supposed to be"?

1334
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:13,355
Well, I could tell you
that they're standing by,

1335
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:14,690
waiting for you
to make the choice

1336
01:18:14,756 --> 01:18:16,591
to remain meekly incarcerated

1337
01:18:16,692 --> 01:18:19,027
or bust the hell out of here
and go and find Trinity.

1338
01:18:20,595 --> 01:18:21,697
But that ain't a choice.

1339
01:18:23,598 --> 01:18:26,034
[dramatic music playing]

1340
01:18:34,342 --> 01:18:36,445
[Sheperd] General,
what should we do?

1341
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,451
[Freya] Bugs has the same
independence of mind

1342
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,019
she had the day you freed her.

1343
01:18:44,086 --> 01:18:47,089
This is not
independence of mind.

1344
01:18:47,189 --> 01:18:48,223
It's mutiny.

1345
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:50,792
[Freya] Come on, 'Be.

1346
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,895
I know how much
you hated locking him up.

1347
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,698
Just like I know
there's a part of you

1348
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:59,801
that's relieved now
that he's gone.

1349
01:19:01,269 --> 01:19:05,107
We've worked so hard
to keep Io safe.

1350
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,478
This scares me.

1351
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:21,323
That's her.

1352
01:19:21,423 --> 01:19:22,557
[Seq] On the bridge.

1353
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:24,092
Got her.

1354
01:19:30,832 --> 01:19:32,667
[engine revving]

1355
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,003
It's sick
how the Semblance works.

1356
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:37,839
You see flashes
of the real her, but...

1357
01:19:37,939 --> 01:19:39,574
the way she reads...

1358
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:43,912
Code-wise,
she's pure bluepill.

1359
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:48,850
This is a tough question, Neo,
but it has to be asked.

1360
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:52,154
What if she's happy
where she is?

1361
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:54,856
How did I read?

1362
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:58,860
Exactly like her.

1363
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:04,866
Take us to broadcast depth.

1364
01:20:04,966 --> 01:20:07,369
[suspenseful music playing]

1365
01:20:16,178 --> 01:20:17,646
Thank you for helping me.

1366
01:20:19,281 --> 01:20:21,283
Most of us are here
because of you.

1367
01:20:23,952 --> 01:20:25,053
I also admit our only chance

1368
01:20:25,153 --> 01:20:26,555
to get out
of the general's doghouse

1369
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:28,290
is for you to find your mojo.

1370
01:20:29,991 --> 01:20:32,561
What if I can't be
what I once was?

1371
01:20:34,129 --> 01:20:35,730
-Then we're all fucked.
-[signal beeps]

1372
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:37,199
[Hanno] Two minutes.

1373
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:38,667
Two minutes to broadcast.

1374
01:20:47,843 --> 01:20:49,177
[Seq] I slipped you in
through a hotel room.

1375
01:20:49,244 --> 01:20:50,912
[Seq chuckles]

1376
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:52,480
Should be safe.

1377
01:21:03,258 --> 01:21:04,759
Portal's open.

1378
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:06,995
Closest I could get you is
the warehouse near her garage.

1379
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:08,597
Whole zone's
crawling with bots.

1380
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:11,533
Let's go.

1381
01:21:38,760 --> 01:21:41,897
So, what do you think of him?

1382
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:44,766
I was kinda worried at first
because he's so much older.

1383
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,369
The beard, the hair... Oh.

1384
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:50,872
-No, totally works for me.
-[scoffs] You idiot.

1385
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:52,307
I mean "The One" thing.

1386
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,945
You know, everyone that
shipped with him died.

1387
01:21:57,045 --> 01:21:59,814
Oh, yeah. He's gonna
get us all killed, for sure.

1388
01:22:03,318 --> 01:22:04,386
[guns cocking]

1389
01:22:05,220 --> 01:22:06,755
Predictable as ever.

1390
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:10,759
Smith.

1391
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:13,161
Smith? As in, "the" Smith?

1392
01:22:13,261 --> 01:22:14,262
[chuckles]

1393
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:22,604
This is so insane.

1394
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:23,939
There's so many theories
about the two of them

1395
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:25,674
and they're standing
right there.

1396
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:27,342
This code is freaky!

1397
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:30,312
He's like an Agent, but not.

1398
01:22:34,482 --> 01:22:36,084
An appeal to reason.

1399
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,790
How did you find us?

1400
01:22:41,856 --> 01:22:44,793
You never appreciated
our relationship.

1401
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,261
Not like The Analyst.

1402
01:22:46,328 --> 01:22:48,263
-The what?
-My doctor.

1403
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:52,033
He used our bond
and turned it into a chain.

1404
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:53,802
It's so obvious
once you see it, right?

1405
01:22:53,868 --> 01:22:57,305
But this whole altered-code
update really blew my mind.

1406
01:22:57,372 --> 01:22:59,374
I still don't know
how he did it.

1407
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:02,277
You, as a balding nerd.

1408
01:23:02,344 --> 01:23:04,112
Hilarious.

1409
01:23:04,179 --> 01:23:06,548
And me... [sighs]

1410
01:23:06,648 --> 01:23:09,317
even more perfect.

1411
01:23:09,384 --> 01:23:11,386
Maybe a little too far
on the piercing blue eyes.

1412
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,388
What do you think?

1413
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,457
What do you want, Smith?

1414
01:23:17,625 --> 01:23:19,894
I have such dreams, Tom.

1415
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,696
Big dreams.

1416
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,532
Well, mostly just extremely
violent revenge fantasies,

1417
01:23:24,632 --> 01:23:26,034
but in order for me
to pursue mine,

1418
01:23:26,134 --> 01:23:28,169
I need to dissuade you
from pursuing yours.

1419
01:23:28,236 --> 01:23:31,873
Hmm. Sounds like conflict.

1420
01:23:33,575 --> 01:23:35,143
Inevitable?

1421
01:23:36,344 --> 01:23:37,679
Doesn't have to be.

1422
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:39,914
All you have to do
is stay out of the Matrix,

1423
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:41,516
and leave
the good doctor to me.

1424
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,918
You can have him.
I'm here for Trinity.

1425
01:23:44,019 --> 01:23:45,520
That's the trouble, Tom.

1426
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:48,256
He knew you'd come,
just like I did.

1427

[scoffs]

1428
01:23:50,025 --> 01:23:51,226
Trust me.

1429
01:23:52,193 --> 01:23:53,728
You're not ready for him.

1430
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:56,598
Captain, I'm reading portals
from the lower frequencies.

1431
01:24:01,903 --> 01:24:05,073
I won't have his leash
on my neck again.

1432
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:14,783
I found some
old acquaintances of yours.

1433
01:24:15,850 --> 01:24:19,220
-Bugs!

Exiles.

1437
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:35,203
I thought
they were all purged.

1438

[man] You?

1439
01:24:36,871 --> 01:24:37,972
[excitedly] Oh!

1440

It is you!

[man speaking French]

1442
01:24:41,743 --> 01:24:45,313
All these years.
I can't believe it.

1443
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:47,649
Oh, God.

1444
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:51,719
You stole my life!

[in English] What the Merv
is trying to say,

1447
01:24:58,093 --> 01:25:00,562
is that their situation

01:36:58,045 --> 01:37:02,716
The only world that matters
is the one in here.

1629
01:37:02,817 --> 01:37:05,820
And you people
believe the craziest shit.

1630
01:37:06,353 --> 01:37:07,621
Why?

1631
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:10,291
What validates
and makes your fictions real?

1632
01:37:11,225 --> 01:37:12,326
Feelings.

1633
01:37:13,494 --> 01:37:14,962
Allow me.

1634
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,998
Kush, here,
is one of my handlers.

1635
01:37:18,065 --> 01:37:19,400
They're everywhere.

1636
01:37:19,500 --> 01:37:22,069
Such a pain, cloning Agents
over a coppertop.

1637
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:24,638
Far more effective
just to saturate a population.

1638
01:37:26,540 --> 01:37:29,410
And, bonus,
swarm mode is sick fun.

1639
01:37:29,510 --> 01:37:30,711
[chuckles]

1640
01:37:37,685 --> 01:37:39,186
[gun fires in slow motion]

1641
01:37:41,856 --> 01:37:44,992
Ooh! Nicely done.

1642
01:37:46,427 --> 01:37:49,697
You ever wonder
why you have nightmares?

1643
01:37:49,763 --> 01:37:52,733
Why your own brain
tortures you?

1644
01:37:52,833 --> 01:37:56,337
It's actually us,
maximizing your output.

1645
01:37:56,403 --> 01:37:57,571
It works just like this.

1646
01:37:57,671 --> 01:38:00,274
Oh, no!
Can you stop the bullet?

1647
01:38:00,374 --> 01:38:03,277
If only you could move faster.

1648
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:05,913
[chuckles] Here's the thing
about feelings.

1649
01:38:06,013 --> 01:38:08,282
They're so much easier
to control than facts.

1650
01:38:09,250 --> 01:38:11,118
Turns out, in my Matrix,

1651
01:38:11,218 --> 01:38:14,688
the worse we treat you,
the more we manipulate you,

1652
01:38:14,755 --> 01:38:17,224
the more energy you produce.

1653
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:19,526
It's nuts. [chomps]

1654
01:38:19,593 --> 01:38:21,195
I've been setting
productivity records

1655
01:38:21,262 --> 01:38:22,563
every year since I took over.

1656
01:38:22,630 --> 01:38:25,466
And, the best part,
zero resistance.

1657
01:38:25,566 --> 01:38:26,934
People stay in their pods,

1658
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:30,104
happier than pigs in shit.

1659
01:38:30,204 --> 01:38:31,405
The key to it all?

1660
01:38:31,472 --> 01:38:32,806
You.

1661
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,074
And her.

1662
01:38:34,141 --> 01:38:36,377
Quietly yearning
for what you don't have,

1663
01:38:36,443 --> 01:38:38,879
while dreading
losing what you do.

1664
01:38:38,946 --> 01:38:40,614
For 99.9% of your race,

1665
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:43,384
that is the definition
of reality.

1666
01:38:43,450 --> 01:38:46,320
Desire and fear, baby.

1667
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:49,390
Just give the people
what they want, right?

1668

[squelches]

1669
01:38:58,666 --> 01:39:01,735
She's the only home
you have, Thomas.

1670

something terrible happens.

-You shouldn't call me that.
-I'm sorry.

1678
01:39:27,661 --> 01:39:28,929
I have to go.

1679
01:39:28,996 --> 01:39:30,164
But I'll be back.

1680

1683
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:40,341
[Sheperd on radio]
General ordered me

1684
01:39:40,441 --> 01:39:41,442
to look after the ship.

1685
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:43,377
So you shadowed us?

1686
01:39:43,477 --> 01:39:45,045
Check your long-range scans.

1687
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:47,147
Squids are combing this area.

1688
01:39:47,214 --> 01:39:48,682
He's right.

1689
01:39:48,782 --> 01:39:49,950
You can stay here and die,

1690
01:39:50,017 --> 01:39:52,386
or come back
and face a court-martial.

1691
01:39:52,486 --> 01:39:54,488
And you call that a choice?

1692
01:40:01,695 --> 01:40:03,831
[Niobe] Sheperd should have
left you to the Squids.

1693
01:40:03,897 --> 01:40:07,301
I'm too damn old to sit
through some boring-ass trial.

1694
01:40:07,368 --> 01:40:08,569
Niobe, don't blame Bugs.

1695
01:40:08,669 --> 01:40:10,571
Do shut your mouth.

1696
01:40:10,671 --> 01:40:12,973
Do address me as General.

1697
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:17,311
And do not rob
my ex-captain of her agency,

1698
01:40:17,378 --> 01:40:19,380
which she exercised
with her own

1699
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:22,983
particular brand
of shortsighted stupidity.

1700
01:40:24,218 --> 01:40:25,319
Shortsighted?

1701
01:40:26,987 --> 01:40:30,924
You care more
about growing fruit
than freeing minds.

1702
01:40:31,025 --> 01:40:33,527
We are not going
to have this argument again.

1703
01:40:33,594 --> 01:40:35,929
It's not an argument.
It's a fact.

1704
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,231
You gave up on people.

1705
01:40:38,699 --> 01:40:41,035
I tell you
what I'm going to give up on

1706
01:40:41,101 --> 01:40:42,202
and it's you!

1707
01:40:44,605 --> 01:40:46,540

out of my sight!

General.

1717
01:41:15,436 --> 01:41:16,737
Thank you for seeing me.

1718
01:41:16,804 --> 01:41:18,605
I figured if there was anyone

1719
01:41:18,705 --> 01:41:20,974
who could make sense
of this mess,

1720
01:41:21,075 --> 01:41:22,876
it would be you.

1721

Hello, Neo.

1722
01:41:24,144 --> 01:41:25,979
I know you.

1723
01:41:26,080 --> 01:41:28,082
I tried to keep my eye on you.

1725
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:32,653

01:41:41,161 --> 01:41:43,664
My father knew
we'd meet again,

1730
01:41:43,764 --> 01:41:46,733
though he would have wished
for happier circumstances.

1731
01:41:46,800 --> 01:41:48,602
His inadvertent role
in what happened to you

1732
01:41:48,669 --> 01:41:50,938
was the greatest regret
of his life.

1733
01:41:51,004 --> 01:41:52,906
I don't understand.

1734
01:41:54,274 --> 01:41:55,943
My father
was the chief engineer

1735
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:57,277
at the Anomaleum.

1736
01:41:57,344 --> 01:41:58,745
[Niobe] The what?

1737
01:41:58,812 --> 01:42:01,915
My father designed
the resurrection pods

1738
01:42:01,982 --> 01:42:03,917
where Neo and Trinity
were imprisoned.

1739
01:42:05,953 --> 01:42:07,187
[Niobe] I'm sorry.

1740
01:42:07,287 --> 01:42:08,789
You knew what happened to him?

1741
01:42:08,856 --> 01:42:12,092
You knew that he and Trinity
both were alive...

1742
01:42:13,093 --> 01:42:14,361
and you didn't tell me?

1743
01:42:14,461 --> 01:42:17,364
There were times
I doubted my decision, Niobe.

1744
01:42:17,464 --> 01:42:19,099
But Io needed you.

1745
01:42:19,166 --> 01:42:20,501
This city needed to be built

1746
01:42:20,601 --> 01:42:22,636
for your people
as well as mine.

1747
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:25,539
If I would have
told you everything,

1748
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,808
you would have had a very
difficult choice to make.

1749
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:29,476
My friends

1750
01:42:30,811 --> 01:42:33,313
let me make my own choices.

1751
01:42:33,380 --> 01:42:35,315
If it was a mistake,

1752
01:42:35,382 --> 01:42:37,484
you have my deepest apologies.

1753
01:42:39,553 --> 01:42:40,888
Why are you here now?

1754
01:42:40,988 --> 01:42:43,490
Neo's escape has
destabilized the Matrix.

The Anomaleum
draws its current

1756
01:42:44,892 --> 01:42:46,226
from Trinity alone now.

1757
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:48,495
A fail-safe has been
triggered to reset

1758
01:42:48,562 --> 01:42:50,564
the Matrix back
to the previous version.

1759
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,466
But The Analyst
halted the reset.

1760
01:42:52,533 --> 01:42:53,834
He's convinced the authorities

1761
01:42:53,901 --> 01:42:55,869
that you will soon
return voluntarily.

1762
01:42:57,004 --> 01:42:58,906
And why would he say that?

1763
01:42:59,006 --> 01:43:02,075
Because if I don't go back,
he'll kill Trinity.

1764

Faced with returning
to your pod

1765
01:43:07,314 --> 01:43:10,083
or enduring
Trinity's death again.

1766
01:43:10,184 --> 01:43:11,485
What would you choose, Neo?

1767
01:43:12,553 --> 01:43:13,854
I'll go back.

1768
01:43:15,556 --> 01:43:17,758
Well, The Analyst
knows you well,

1769
01:43:17,858 --> 01:43:20,594
but that knowledge
has made him incautious.

1770
01:43:20,694 --> 01:43:22,362
After you escaped,

1771
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:25,265
he should have
accepted his losses
and devacuated Trinity.

1772
01:43:25,365 --> 01:43:28,235
But that would have prevented
this extraordinary opportunity

1773
01:43:28,335 --> 01:43:30,237
that now exists before us.

1774
01:43:30,904 --> 01:43:33,840
A few hours ago,

1775
01:43:33,907 --> 01:43:37,211
no one would have been able
to convince me

1776
01:43:37,277 --> 01:43:41,582
that I would be standing here,
trying to explain a mission

1777
01:43:41,682 --> 01:43:43,617

-Volunteering.
-Oh, no.

01:43:50,757 --> 01:43:55,295
You are the one captain
that I am ordering to go.

1781
01:43:55,395 --> 01:43:56,964
Now you don't
have to order me, General,

1782
01:43:57,064 --> 01:43:58,732
'cause I'm volunteering.

1783
01:44:02,102 --> 01:44:03,637
I need two more.

1784
01:44:08,141 --> 01:44:10,978
Are you out of your minds?

1785
01:44:11,078 --> 01:44:12,946
You don't even know
what it is.

1786
01:44:13,046 --> 01:44:15,949
General, we know you.

1787
01:44:16,049 --> 01:44:17,251
If you say this is important,

1788
01:44:17,317 --> 01:44:19,386
none of us is
choosing to stay home.

1789
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:25,826
Thank you.

1790
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:32,933
Knuckle up, and good luck.

[Sati] Trinity is held
in the Anomaleum,

1794
01:45:04,531 --> 01:45:06,300
which is in this
transmission tower.

1795
01:45:06,366 --> 01:45:08,635
The passages used
to rescue Neo are now sealed

1796

and a legion of Sentinels
patrols the tower.

1797
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:13,040
So, stealth will be paramount.

1798
01:45:13,140 --> 01:45:14,875
As long as we raise no alarms,

1799
01:45:14,975 --> 01:45:17,044
this first part of the mission
should be the easiest.

of Sentinels?

01:45:23,717 --> 01:45:24,885
That's the easy part?

1805
01:45:24,985 --> 01:45:26,653
Exactly so.

1806
01:45:26,720 --> 01:45:29,056
Because all we have to do
is convince someone

1807
01:45:29,156 --> 01:45:30,824
who does this every day

1808
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:32,326
to take one of us along.

1809
01:45:32,392 --> 01:45:34,461
-[electricity crackling]
-[dramatic music continues]

1810
01:45:55,849 --> 01:45:57,684
Fifty meters
below the Anomaleum

1811
01:45:57,751 --> 01:45:59,252
is a stratum
of amniotic filters.

1812
01:45:59,353 --> 01:46:02,756
Hidden along this edge
is a small hexagonal vent.

1813
01:46:02,856 --> 01:46:06,026
This vent feeds the air intake
into the corpuscular modifier,

1814
01:46:06,093 --> 01:46:09,196
which oxygenates
the bio-gel used in Neo's pod.

1815
01:46:09,863 --> 01:46:11,064
I get it.

1816
01:46:11,164 --> 01:46:14,034
The exomorph slinkies up
Neo's old umbilicus.

1817
01:46:15,268 --> 01:46:16,403
What could go wrong?

1818
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:18,872
[tense music playing]

1819

[straining]

1821
01:47:03,283 --> 01:47:04,651
[Sati]  Once inside,

1822
01:47:04,751 --> 01:47:06,586
Morpheus will use
the System Operator

1823
01:47:06,653 --> 01:47:08,989
to open the devacuator line
and disengage the macerators.

1824
01:47:09,089 --> 01:47:10,490
[machinery clanking]

1825
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:14,661
In order to unplug
Trinity's body,

1826
01:47:14,761 --> 01:47:16,963
while her mind still remains
connected to the Matrix,

1827
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:18,665
I'm gonna need
a second human brain

1828
01:47:18,765 --> 01:47:19,966
to implement the bypass.

1829
01:47:20,066 --> 01:47:21,668
And since Neo
must be with The Analyst,

1830
01:47:21,768 --> 01:47:24,938
the only available mind
that's a near-enough match

1831
01:47:25,005 --> 01:47:26,072
is yours.

1832
01:47:27,607 --> 01:47:28,508
Figures.

1833
01:47:28,608 --> 01:47:30,177
[tense music playing]

1834
01:47:46,026 --> 01:47:47,160
Thanks, Cybebe.

1835
01:47:48,195 --> 01:47:49,196
[grunts]

1836
01:47:55,368 --> 01:47:57,370
Does Trinity still have
to take the red pill?

1837
01:47:57,471 --> 01:47:58,872
Since Kujaku and I
are transferring

1838
01:47:58,972 --> 01:48:00,273
her consciousness
onto the ship,

1839
01:48:00,340 --> 01:48:02,008
it's not strictly necessary.

1840
01:48:02,108 --> 01:48:06,012
But what matters is that
this is her choice.

1841
01:48:06,112 --> 01:48:09,382
Extracting a confused
or an uncertain mind will,

1842
01:48:09,483 --> 01:48:10,851
in all probability, kill her.

1843
01:48:10,951 --> 01:48:13,487
But even if it is
what she wants,

1844
01:48:13,553 --> 01:48:17,224
won't The Analyst just order
the Sentinels to stop you?

1845
01:48:17,324 --> 01:48:18,825
He will.

1846
01:48:18,892 --> 01:48:21,361
But if my plan works,
it won't matter.

1847
01:48:21,461 --> 01:48:22,395
Why?

1848
01:48:22,496 --> 01:48:24,130
Because we'll already be gone.

1849
01:48:25,832 --> 01:48:27,734
Somebody thinks
this hard about a plan,

1850
01:48:27,834 --> 01:48:29,236
there has to be a reason why.

1851
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:32,672
When my father realized

1852
01:48:32,739 --> 01:48:35,008
how the Anomaleum
was going to be used,

1853
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:38,545
he covertly transferred
the designs to me.

1854
01:48:38,645 --> 01:48:41,147
The Analyst
discovered his betrayal

1855
01:48:41,214 --> 01:48:43,083
and had my parents purged.

1856
01:48:44,251 --> 01:48:45,652
[inhales sharply]

1857
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:48,722
I would have been murdered too
if it wasn't for Kujaku.

1858
01:48:51,758 --> 01:48:55,762
Not a day goes by
that I don't grieve them.

1859
01:48:55,862 --> 01:48:58,999
I've been praying for this day
for a very long time.

1860
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:03,703
[door unlocks, opens]

1861
01:49:07,073 --> 01:49:08,608
We're coming up on broadcast.

1862
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:15,215
I thought you should know
that I'm here because of her.

1863
01:49:18,718 --> 01:49:21,087
All I ever wanted was to be
as fearless as Trinity.

1864
01:49:23,290 --> 01:49:26,726
But I saw how she reacted
in the garage, and I...

1865
01:49:26,793 --> 01:49:29,429
You're wondering if I'm wrong.

1866
01:49:29,529 --> 01:49:31,064
What if we're too late?

1867
01:49:32,866 --> 01:49:34,568
What if she's not
Trinity anymore?

1868
01:49:36,403 --> 01:49:37,637
[sighs]

1869
01:49:39,973 --> 01:49:42,742
I never believed
I was The One.

1870
01:49:43,610 --> 01:49:45,045
But she did.

1871
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:47,714
She believed in me.

1872
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:52,586
It's my turn
to believe in her.

1873
01:49:53,720 --> 01:49:54,721
[sighs]

1874
01:49:56,923 --> 01:49:58,959
[suspenseful music playing]

1875
01:50:17,577 --> 01:50:19,479
[Sati] This is
where it gets tricky.

1876
01:50:30,624 --> 01:50:33,026
Have you ever done
an operation like this?

1877
01:50:33,760 --> 01:50:34,828
Not yet.

1878
01:50:38,465 --> 01:50:40,433
[suspenseful music builds]

1879
01:50:56,549 --> 01:50:57,884
Here we go.

1880
01:50:57,984 --> 01:50:59,886
[suspenseful music continues]

1881
01:51:15,535 --> 01:51:17,470
Welcome home.

1882
01:51:17,537 --> 01:51:19,906
All I want is to talk to her.

1883
01:51:20,006 --> 01:51:21,641
Do you mean Tiff?

1884
01:51:21,708 --> 01:51:24,477
Come back,
and you can talk to her
as often as you like.

1885
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:25,912
I mean, handsome Chad

1886
01:51:26,012 --> 01:51:27,480
may have something
to say about it.

1887
01:51:27,547 --> 01:51:30,850
If she tells me
this is what she wants,

1888
01:51:32,052 --> 01:51:33,219
you win.

1889
01:51:33,319 --> 01:51:34,421
Really?

1890
01:51:34,521 --> 01:51:37,257
But if she wants me,

1891
01:51:37,357 --> 01:51:39,192
then you'll let us go free.

1892
01:51:39,259 --> 01:51:42,028
And why would I do something
as stupid as that?

1893
01:51:42,095 --> 01:51:44,898
Right now,
I'm on a ship full of people
who will unplug me

1894
01:51:44,998 --> 01:51:48,001
before they'll let you
take me back.

1895
01:51:48,068 --> 01:51:50,103
If you want this Matrix,

1896
01:51:50,203 --> 01:51:51,738
this is your only chance.

1897
01:51:51,838 --> 01:51:54,774
But how do I know
they won't unplug you anyway?

1898
01:51:54,874 --> 01:51:58,211
Same way I know you'll let us
walk out of here.

1899
01:51:59,512 --> 01:52:01,781
[suspenseful music playing]

1900
01:52:23,803 --> 01:52:25,472
Okay.

1901
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:27,073
I like tests.

1902
01:52:27,941 --> 01:52:29,743
We'll let Tiff decide.

1903
01:52:29,809 --> 01:52:31,578

[Sati breathing heavily]

1905
01:52:47,093 --> 01:52:48,261
That's it.

1906
01:52:49,462 --> 01:52:50,997
Bypass is ready.

1907
01:52:51,097 --> 01:52:52,799
Now what?

1908
01:52:52,899 --> 01:52:54,134
We wait.

1909
01:52:54,234 --> 01:52:56,169
Doesn't it seem crazy
to come all this way

1910
01:52:56,269 --> 01:52:57,837
and leave her here?

1911
01:52:57,937 --> 01:53:00,607
We must abide by her decision.

1912
01:53:00,673 --> 01:53:02,275
And if she says no,

1913
01:53:03,109 --> 01:53:04,577
what happens to Neo?

1914
01:53:04,644 --> 01:53:05,845
At this time,

1915
01:53:05,945 --> 01:53:08,782
the most important choice
of Neo's life

1916
01:53:08,848 --> 01:53:10,350
is not his to make.

1917
01:53:17,357 --> 01:53:19,626
[slow suspenseful
music playing]

1918
01:53:41,381 --> 01:53:43,183
I saw this in my dream.

1919
01:53:44,651 --> 01:53:48,121
If I was the Oracle,
maybe I could explain it.

1920
01:53:48,788 --> 01:53:50,356
The Oracle.

1921
01:53:50,456 --> 01:53:52,125
From your game?

1922
01:53:53,993 --> 01:53:56,229
It's not a game.

1923
01:53:58,364 --> 01:53:59,566
Oh, God.

1924
01:54:04,337 --> 01:54:05,738
[Tiffany sighs]

1925
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:10,476
After you left, I went home

1926
01:54:10,543 --> 01:54:12,245
and I played it.

1927
01:54:14,647 --> 01:54:17,083
I kept thinking,

1928
01:54:17,183 --> 01:54:20,520
why does this story
feel like a memory?

1929
01:54:27,694 --> 01:54:29,429
There's a part of me

1930
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:35,235
that feels like
I have been waiting
my whole life for you.

1931
01:54:38,204 --> 01:54:40,440
And that part is like,

1932
01:54:40,540 --> 01:54:44,244
"What the hell
took you so long?" [sniffles]

1933
01:54:44,344 --> 01:54:46,379
I don't have an easy answer.

1934
01:54:48,548 --> 01:54:50,717
Maybe I was afraid of this.

1935
01:54:52,185 --> 01:54:54,053
Afraid of what might happen.

1936
01:54:55,555 --> 01:54:58,558
Afraid of hurting
the only person I ever loved.

1937
01:55:00,260 --> 01:55:03,796
I wish I was
who you think I am.

1938
01:55:05,198 --> 01:55:06,766
But look at me.

1939
01:55:08,067 --> 01:55:10,236
I can't be her.

1940
01:55:10,303 --> 01:55:12,438
-[Donnie] Mom!
-[Brandon] Mom! Come on.

1941
01:55:12,538 --> 01:55:13,773
-Mom!
-It's Callie.

1942
01:55:13,873 --> 01:55:14,874
Is this real?

1943
01:55:14,941 --> 01:55:16,109
[Donnie]
You have to come with us.

1944
01:55:16,209 --> 01:55:17,577
[Brandon] Come on,
we gotta go.

1945
01:55:17,644 --> 01:55:19,145
Tiff, hey. Don't know
what's going on here,

1946
01:55:19,245 --> 01:55:20,580
but I'm glad we found you.

1947
01:55:20,647 --> 01:55:21,948
-She got hit by a car!
-I know, it's crazy.

1948
01:55:22,048 --> 01:55:23,149
She was chasing after you.

1949
01:55:23,249 --> 01:55:24,584
They're casting her arm.
We gotta go.

1950
01:55:24,651 --> 01:55:26,052
[Chad] Doctor said
she's gonna be fine.

01:55:26,119 --> 01:55:27,921
[Donnie] You have to come
with us to the hospital.

1952
01:55:27,987 --> 01:55:29,088
It's too late.

1953
01:55:29,155 --> 01:55:30,390
I understand.

1954
01:55:30,456 --> 01:55:32,292
-Tiff, come on, let's go.
-[Donnie] Come on.

1955
01:55:38,798 --> 01:55:39,899
What's happening?

1956
01:55:41,968 --> 01:55:43,102
Neo was wrong.

[somber music playing]

Tiffany, you have
to come with us.

Tiffany! [echoing]

I wish you would
fucking stop calling me that.

1962
01:56:32,785 --> 01:56:34,320
I hate that name.

1963
01:56:35,822 --> 01:56:37,357
My name is Trinity

1964
01:56:37,457 --> 01:56:39,826
and you better
take your hands off of me.

Aye-yi-yi, what a mess.

1972
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:13,026
I own that mistake.
Shouldn't have pressed.

Women used to be
so easy to control.

1974

You know there's no way
I can let you two go free.

1975
01:57:24,170 --> 01:57:25,605
Cannot happen.

1976
01:57:28,775 --> 01:57:31,611
So, I guess it's deja vu
all over again.

1977
01:57:32,745 --> 01:57:34,547
She dies

1978
01:57:34,614 --> 01:57:36,015
and it's all your fault.

02:15:33,925 --> 02:15:35,827
They don't want
freedom or empowerment.

2162
02:15:35,927 --> 02:15:38,330
They want to be controlled.

2163
02:15:38,430 --> 02:15:40,365
They crave
the comfort of certainty.

2164
02:15:40,465 --> 02:15:43,201
And that means you two,
back in your pods,

2165
02:15:43,301 --> 02:15:46,838
unconscious and alone,
just like them.

2166
02:15:48,773 --> 02:15:51,009
[both chuckle]

2167
02:15:51,109 --> 02:15:53,812
We're not here
to negotiate anything.

2168
02:15:53,879 --> 02:15:56,148
We were on our way
to remake your world.

2169
02:15:56,214 --> 02:15:57,782
Change a few things.

2170
02:15:57,849 --> 02:15:59,050
I kind of like

2171
02:15:59,151 --> 02:16:00,485
the "paint the sky
with rainbows" idea.

2172
02:16:00,552 --> 02:16:02,487
Just remind people
what a free mind can do.

2173
02:16:02,554 --> 02:16:04,055
I forgot. It's easy to forget.

2174
02:16:04,156 --> 02:16:06,558
-He makes it easy.
-That, he does.

2175
02:16:06,658 --> 02:16:08,860
Something he should
think about.

2176
02:16:09,861 --> 02:16:11,062
Before we got started,

2177
02:16:11,163 --> 02:16:13,999
we decided to stop by
to say thank you.

2178
02:16:14,065 --> 02:16:17,169
You gave us something
we never thought we could have.

2179
02:16:17,235 --> 02:16:18,637
And what is that?

2180
02:16:19,504 --> 02:16:21,306
Another chance.

2181
02:16:21,373 --> 02:16:23,308
[punk rock music playing]

2182
02:27:24,535 --> 02:27:27,338
Face reality, people.
Movies are dead.

2183
02:27:27,405 --> 02:27:29,340
Games are dead.

2184
02:27:29,407 --> 02:27:31,175
Narrative? Dead.

2185
02:27:31,242 --> 02:27:33,211
Media is nothing
but neuro-trigger response

2186
02:27:33,311 --> 02:27:34,512
and viral conditioning.

2187
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:36,080
Wait, what are you two
talking about?

2188
02:27:38,349 --> 02:27:40,184
Cat videos.

2189
02:27:40,251 --> 02:27:44,021
What we need is
a series of videos

2190
02:27:44,088 --> 02:27:46,424
that we call "The Catrix."
